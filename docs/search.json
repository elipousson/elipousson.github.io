    "text": "From a “Development plan for the Maryland State governmental center in Baltimore, Maryland,” 1969. Archive.org\n\n\nOver the last few years working as preservationist in Baltimore City, I’ve been confronted with the enduring presence of built history of post-WWII urban renewal. Even beyond such clear landmarks as 1950s Charles Center or the 1970s “Highway to Nowhere,” much of the area in and around downtown Baltimore is indelibly marked by parks, parking lots, apartment towers and vacant houses that can be directly linked the broader mess of politics and policies that we remember as urban renewal. Over the next couple of months, I’m hoping to push beyond my still somewhat muddled understanding of this issue to write up a more comprehensive narrative of post-WWII urban renewal efforts in Baltimore.\nMy excuse for this new effort is a recent idea to organize a bike tour of urban renewal sites in downtown and west Baltimore mapped out here. Accordingly, this project may have a second life for Baltimore Heritage but, for the time being, I’m undertaking this as a personal and independent research effort. The topic feels even more urgent considering the proposal to demolish Baltimore’s Mechanic Theater - a Brutalist 1967 theater built as part of the Charles Center complex. Despite the challenges posed by the Mechanic (and other buildings like it) to sustainability and urban design, I still hold what I might call a Fuck Yeah Brutalism attitude – the belief that the buildings and landscapes of the 1950s, 60s and 70s (and the stories of behind them) make up an important legacy in the social and built history of our region that should be recognized and interpreted, not ignored and demolished.\nSo this is No. 1 in a new series on urban renewal histories in Baltimore. I’m hoping to make this a weekly endeavor so look out for more soon.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Notes on {Urban} {Renewal} in {Baltimore} - {No.} 1},\n  date = {2012-06-03},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-06-03-notes-on-urban-renewal-in-baltimore-no-1},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “Notes on Urban Renewal in Baltimore - No.\n1.” June 3, 2012. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-06-03-notes-on-urban-renewal-in-baltimore-no-1."

    "text": "I just stumbled across an amazing piece printed in very first issue of the Maryland Colonization Journal in 1841. The piece - titled “An Important Subject Noted” - excerpts in full another article published in the Emancipator and Free American - an abolitionist paper published in New York and Boston.\nIn the piece, I was excited to find a reflection on the interracial makeup of the forces at the 1814 Battle of North Point and the the naval forces more broadly during the War of 1812. The example is used to illustrate the nation’s retreat from an integrated military (the U.S. Army formally prohibited enlistment for “Negroes and Mullatoes” in 1820) and urge free blacks to maintain an ’organized neutrality in the case of a military conflict involving the U.S. writing:\n\n“Shall we a third time kiss the foot that crushes us? If so, we deserve our chains. No! let us maintain an organized neutrality, until the laws of the Union and of all the states have made us free and equal citizens.”\n\nThe full piece is pretty fascinating but I pulled the quote on the Battle of North Point and the War of 1812 for its particular local interest.\n\nAn Important Subject Noted\nThe ‘Emancipator and Free American,’ the leading abolition paper of the north, has the following article which we copy entire that our Maryland readers may know something of what is going on out o’doors… we consider its character the most seditious and mischievous of any thing we have lately seen…\nThe Duty of Coloured Americans …\nA large proportion of the seamen by whom our principal victories were gained in that war, were men of colour, who were then enlisted without restriction, but now we have a standing general order of the navy, that not more than five in a hundred seamen enlisted, shall be coloured – and this is officially explained to be for the purpose of confining coloured men to menial services on board our vessels of war! Said a brave man in Baltimore, who fought in the defence of North Point and afterwards served against Algiers in the Guerriere,\n\n‘there we stood intermingled, white and coloured, manning the same gun, and shot down indiscriminately; the officers exhorted us to fight bravely in the defence of our country; and then after the war was over they tried to get us to go to Africa, and told us that was our country; but I will not go. I feel that this is my country and that I shall never go out of it alive.’\n\n\nThe Maryland Colonization Journal was published by the Maryland State Colonization Society an organization dedicated to promoting the transportation of manumitted enslaved people and free blacks to the west coast of Africa from 1827 to 1863. Records and correspondence from the  history of the Maryland State Colonization Society are housed at the Maryland Historical Society (MS 571) and a substantial portion of the microfilm from that collection has been digitized by the Maryland State Archives.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2013,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{I} Feel That This Is My Country and That {I} Shall Never Go\n    Out of It Alive.”},\n  date = {2013-12-07},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2013-12-07-i-feel-that-this-is-my-country-and-that-i-shall-never-go-out-of-it-alive},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2013. “‘I Feel That This Is My Country and\nThat I Shall Never Go Out of It Alive.’” December 7, 2013.\nhttps://elipousson.github.io/posts/2013-12-07-i-feel-that-this-is-my-country-and-that-i-shall-never-go-out-of-it-alive."

    "text": "Over the past year, I’ve helped to start the Preservation Rightsizing Network to bring greater attention to the intersecting issues of historic preservation and “rightsizing” in cities like Baltimore. My participation in this project has sparked my interested in digging into the history of how vacant properties have been discussed and managed in Baltimore throughout our city’s history.\n\n\n\nPhotograph by Ben Marcin via Slate.\n\n\nInitial research turned up a report from 1994 highlighting an initiative (“never tried before on a citywide scale in Baltimore”) by Mayor Kurt Schmoke to restore or raze vacant rowhouses. Digging back a bit earlier, I found discussion under Mayor Theodore McKeldin who sought and received a new local ordinance allowing the city to demolish houses after they had been “boarded” for ninety days or more. McKeldin tied vacant houses to public health and safety, remarking in 1964:\n\n“Vacant houses not only have a blighting effect on the areas around them but they are also an open invitation to vandals and a potential hazard for children who attempt to play within such buildings.”\n\nI was unsurprised to find these connections back to post-WWII urban renewal efforts but I am even more intrigued by the intense debate around vacancy that took place over fifty years before in the summer of 1910.\nOn August 21, 1910, the Baltimore Police Board Published a “complete census” to count all of the city’s vacant and occupied dwellings. A member of the  prominent local real estate firm William Martien & Company had suggested the survey to the Secretary of the board, reportedly, “As a result of the agitation over the number of vacant houses.” The census found that the Northwestern district led the city with over 1,300 vacant dwellings. Realtor James Cary Martien pointed to the city’s rapid suburban growth and the aging core as the cause, remarking:\n\n“The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore”\n\nIn the weeks that followed the publication of the report, a series of letters to the Sun expanded on Martien’s summary and tied the issue to the fights over “negro invasion” and the aggressive efforts by some white elected officials and property-owners to enforce racial segregation in residential neighborhoods.\nWhen some residents argued that high taxes brought on vacant and abandoned houses, one northwest Baltimore resident wrote back under the name “Pure White” in a letter published on August 27 —\n\n“Taxes may, and I presume do, have something to do with it; for our taxes are inordinately and unnecessarily high, but the possibility, and indeed the probability, of the negro neighbor is the main reason…\nWhen a man works and saves and buys a home thinking it will be his shelter in his old age, and wakes up some morning to find he has a negro neighbor, he feels hurt and aggrieved that he has to give up his home, but he moves… I know of three families who want to buy a home this fall and they prefer the city to the suburbs, but they are hesitating because of this disagreeable possibility. We of the northwestern section have enough to bear in our close proximity to their noisy and disagreeable alleys, and we don’t want them next door to us. The real estate men—a few of them, not all—are to blame for the vacant houses and with them, lies the remedy.”\n\nOn September 2, 1910, another local echoed this sentiment and signed their letter “Justice” in a call for the city to protect him from the possibility of black neighbors —\n\n“The writer has been living for nearly half a century in a neighborhood now threatened with negro invasion. There are several vacant houses in the block, and this fear may be the potent cause of non-rental or sale. Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest. We live in daily dread that we may be driven out and forced to sell at a depreciated price if we can sell at all.”\n\nOn September 15, 1910, another letter recognized the alarming “negro invasion” but still gave priority to the threat of high taxes —\n\n“The vacant house problem in the city should be one of grave concern at this time to our municipal administrators, to our real estate agents and to those having the welfare of the city at heart.\nIt is not a temporary but a growing evil that is confronting and threatening every owner of property. The number of vacant houses has grown and grown until at last there is common alarm in the matter, and justly so. What then are the causes producing this condition? There are many, but the fundamental one is purely economic—high taxes.\nThere are other contributing causes, but high taxes are essentially at the root of this ever dangerously increasing trouble. Negro invasion into heretofore white residential neighborhoods is undoubtedly aggravating the situation, and the alarm at such invasion is becoming more and more evidenced by the strained and tense feeling of the people residing in such invaded neighborhoods.”\n\nI’m hoping to put a bit more time into this research over the next month and give these letters the context they deserve. Check out Garrett Power’s excellent 1983 history of the city’s residential racial segregation ordinances in the early 1910s for some excellent background.\nSources: All of the letters are from the Baltimore Sun through the ProQuest Historical Newspapers database - I’ll come back and add full citations sometime this week.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2014,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{Each} Vacant House Is a Standing Menace to the Rest.”},\n  date = {2014-07-21},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2014-07-21-each-vacant-house-is-a-standing-menace-to-the-rest},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2014. “‘Each Vacant House Is a Standing Menace\nto the Rest.’” July 21, 2014. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2014-07-21-each-vacant-house-is-a-standing-menace-to-the-rest."

    "text": "“City of Baltimore / Wall Painting Project / Project Supported by the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, D.C. A Federal Agency”\n\n\nIn September 1973, Mayor William Donald Schaefer led an effort to commission a set of ten murals funded by a $10,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. 85 artists submitted over 200 designs to the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) for a competition reviewed by a panel of judges including: Jane Harrison Cone, a curator of the Baltimore Museum of Art, Serena Jordan of Northwest Baltimore Corporation, James Lewis, a professor of Morgan State and founder of the James E. Lewis Museum of Art, M. Jay Brodie of DHCD, Betty Wells, a local artist, and Joan Berska of the Mayor’s office.\n\n\n\nMayor William Donald Schaefer dedicating the Patterson Park Mural, photograph from “Bringing color, design to some of Baltimore’s blankest, dullest walls” Oct. 12, 1974.\n\n\nThe panel selected ten winning designs and provided each artist with donated paint (Sears offered around 80 gallons), scaffolding, and a a $1000 honorarium. By July 1974 nearly all ten of the murals were complete and Mayor William Donald Schaefer was pleased with how the colorful murals had brightened the streetscape, remarking on a bus tour of the murals in early October:\n\n“It’s a psychological thing. I don’t know if you’ve heard my lecture: If you go into a neighborhood and it’s dull an drab, you’re dull and drab. But if you go into a neighborhood and it’s bright and clean you feel better. You expect big things to be done. But it’s the little things that make the difference between living in a city and just existing.”\n\nMayor William Donald Schaefer’s bus tour was followed by a bike tour of a selection of eight of the ten artworks organized by the Baltimore Bicycling Club, Citizens For Bikeways and the Better Air Coalition to kick off Clean Air Week in Maryland.\nBill Tashlick, who led the ride, was an architect with the Rouse Company before starting work with the Baltimore Department of Planning in 1971. As the chairman of a joint bicycle task force including government agencies and citizens groups, he worked  with the Maryland Department of Transportation on the design of bikeways across the state.\n\n\n\nGil and JoJo Watson bike touring near Chesterton, Baltimore Sun Archive Photo, BQJ-750-BS\n\n\nTashlick’s bike tour of Baltimore murals began at Roland and Lake Avenues near the city line at the top of one of the city’s first designated bikeways. Gil Watson - who covered cycling for The Baltimore Sun in the 1970s and by the 1990s worked as the paper’s Sunday editor -  joined the group of 23 cyclists on a chilly Sunday morning and provided an fascinating account that sketches out the 10 mile route:\n\nDown Roland avenue, down University to San Martin, Howard to North. First stop was North and Park avenue where, in huge, cheerful block letters the word “Baltimore” itself is immortalized. … From Park we worked over to the 1800 block McCulloh, where a bold wall of yellow, green, orange and chartreuse (I think) rose from a small expanse of open grass. (All the murals are graced with a bit of open space.) Sunday early-risers eyed us as we eyed the wall.\nBehind the Afro-American at Druid Hill avenue and Jasper street, a stylized pair of black dancers frozen on a white background was stop No. 3. No. 4 was the coffeeshop across from the Greyhound terminal on Howard. … Moving out again, some of us still carrying coffee, we headed for the Police Stables on the Fallsway, where a big horizontal design plays perspective games with motorists headed north.\nWe then chugged up to the corner of Barclay and East Chase. Kids were playing basketball in front of another mural, this one a towering vertical in green and white. … Two more stops, one at Aisquith and Lanvale, the other in the 1600 block North Calvert, and we ended our mural tour at what is surely one of the most intriguing - Robert Hieronymous’s creation at Lanvale and St. Paul. Fantastically detailed, intricate and dominated by a one-eyed pyramid and an eagle, it has to be seen to be appreciated.\nFor that matter, they all have to be seen. The ride took roughly two hours (skipping one painting in Patterson Park facing Baltimore street and another at West Mulberry and Mount).\n\n[googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=201251479367009811123.0004d89bcc5d6a4e7aa06&ie=UTF8&t=p&ll=39.307074,-76.616764&spn=0.046489,0.085831&z=13&output=embed&w=500&h=350]\nThis map involves a bit of conjecture as Gil Watson left out some details on their route towards the end of the ride. A few of the murals have survived the 30 years since but most are faded beyond any recognition or lost altogether. The mural painted for the police stables on the Fallsway still sports a small metal sign that appropriately credits funding for the “Wall Painting Project” to the NEA.  Look out for an update with a gallery of the ghosts of surviving murals later this summer or follow the route to see how many you can spot yourself.\n\n\n\nRobert Hieronimus meditating in his backyard pyramid, 1974, Baltimore Sun Archive Photo, BHH-896-BS\n\n\nSources\nBanisky, Sandy. “Bringing Color, Design to Some of Baltimore’s Blankest, Dullest Walls.” The Sun (1837-1987).

    "title": "Before Freddie Gray: “The Police Board… made an order forbidding public parades”",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday, thousands of people assembled in downtown Baltimore to protest the death of Freddie Gray. Despite a largely peaceful assembly, media coverage of the protests has focused on the handful of vehicles and storefronts damaged during the day. This morning, I appreciated activist Deray McKesson’s reflections on troubling issues with the coverage of the protest  and the false equivalency between property damage and violence. While researching the history of police violence in Baltimore, I came across an early example of the police response to a black public assembly that I’d like to juxtapose with yesterday’s events.\n\n\n\nJohn T. Gray from “Our police” (1888)\n\n\nThe account of this police response, published in 1883, describes how the Baltimore Police Marshal John T. Gray “took every precaution for the prevention of an outbreak” of violence during a celebratory parade and political rally that followed the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870. It continues to share how black men in Baltimore organized “dozens of military companies,” armed with “old army muskets” and drilled on Baltimore’s streets. After the shooting young man by members of one of these regiments, Marshal John T. Gray attacks one of the companies (unclear if it was the same group implicated in the shooting), arrests their officers, and disarms the men.\nIt is hard to interpret this account from our contemporary perspective. I haven’t been able to fully corroborate this account in the Baltimore Sun, but if we accept this account as accurate it is important to note that the Baltimore police didn’t respond to the shooting by attempting arrest the individuals directly involved. Instead, the Baltimore Police Board “made an order forbidding public parades” and Police Marshal Gray targeted the most prominent company of black troops - the “crack” Lincoln Guard. By disarming and dismantling these organizations, the Baltimore police eliminated an important vehicle for black Baltimoreans to mobilize Republican voters and defend themselves against violence.\nTo be clear: I’m not arguing that the actions of the Baltimore police in 2015 are equivalent to the actions of the police in 1871. I’m not trying to suggest that the Lincoln Guard are the same as the protestors here today. However, the story contains important elements–elite fear of black public assembly, racist images of black political action, and the role of the police in protecting an ambiguous public interest–that suggest an important continuity between Baltimore in the 1870s and today.\nOn November 1, 1870, the Baltimore Sun, then strongly opposed to the Republican party and black suffrage, reported on a Democratic political rally where the images of black men armed with bayonets and black elected officials depicted as criminals were prominently displayed:\n\nA grand demonstration of the democratic conservative party, comprising an immense and brilliant procession, with torches, banners and devices, and an overwhelming mass meeting in Monument Square, took place last night upon the call of the democratic executive committee of the city. […]\nThirteenth Ward–James Cosgove, chief marshal.–The display in this ward was good though in point of number not so large. A wagon, drawn by four horses, contained a monument, upon the front of which was a life-size portrait of Washington. […] There was a representation of a company of colored men pointing their bayonets at the place of holding the polls, with the inscription, “What free American has come to under radical rule.” There was also a picture of a man in the act of stealing spoons, with inscription as to type of the radical Congress, &c.\n\nAt the same rally, Thomas Swann, the immediate past Governor of Maryland and a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, shared his own comments on the threat of organized black voters:\n\n[General Creswell] had come here to [Baltimore] to marshal his negro crowd of voters, and to attempt to overawe the democracy with threats of what the President would do with his soldiers.\n\nBaltimore’s newly enfranchised black citizens, including many veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops, could clearly see this procession and assembly as a serious threat to their own hard-won rights. But the police, of course, did not shut down Democratic rallies or parades. And in January 1870 the Democratic party (and the Baltimore Sun) opposed the Enforcement Act of 1871 empowering President Ulysses S. Grant to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in trying to end the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).\nThis history can help us think about what we will fight for and what we won’t. Here is the account for your consideration:\n\nAs Marshal of Baltimore Mr. Gray achieved a national reputation by the reforms he instituted and by the skill with which lie handled his force on many critical occasions. The great Emancipation Jubilee of the negroes in 1870 was the first serious occasion upon which Marshal Gray’s skill as a policeman showed itself prominently. This was the celebration by the negroes of their emancipation. In Baltimore, as well as in all the other Southern cities, certain classes of the white population still harbored a bitter feeling against the negroes, intensified by the offensive manner in which many of the latter had conducted themselves since their emancipation. The law abiding citizens, therefore looked with trepidation upon the preparations of the colored folk for this jubilee, and Marshal Gray took every precaution for the prevention of an outbreak. The day came and one of the most enormous civic parades ever witnessed in the United States took place. Fully ninety per cent of all the negroes in Baltimore and the surrounding country took part, either in the parade itself or as applauding spectators. It is estimated that not less than 30,000 negroes were in line. The parade marched past a certain point from before noon till well into the night before the last platoon had gone by.\n]\nThe populace of both races were apparently willing to fight and a general collision seemed imminent all day, but the police were everywhere, with their eyes on every man who seemed belligerently inclined. The moral influence of the force seemed to subdue the would-be rioters, and though a few unimportant brawls, took place the jubilee passed off without serious trouble anywhere in the city. Marshal Gray received flattering commendations from the newspapers and from citizens for the admirable manner in which the peace of the city was preserved during the critical period.\nAfter the Emancipation Jubilee a military spirit seemed suddenly to seize the negro population of Baltimore. Dozens of military companies were formed, which drilled every evening in the streets much to the annoyance of quiet people. After the war an immense number of old-fashioned muskets were stored in the city by the United States Government. Of the old army muskets alone there were more than 12,000 stand. By some means these arms all fell into the hands of the negroes and they used them for their military companies. These organizations banded into regiments and numbered themselves the First, Second, Third, etc., Maryland Colored Regiments, although they were never admitted to the National Guard, nor recognized by the State military authorities. The South being at that time in a state of reconstruction the negroes were suffered to commit many offenses against the public peace which would never have been attempted or permitted on the part of the whites. Before long the negro regiments began the practice of taking full possession of every street they entered. They would march with fixed bayonets through the principal streets and clear everything before them from curb to curb. Wagons, carriages, and horse cars had to be turned back before them or else they were driven back under bayonet charge.\nOne evening in May 1871, the colored troops came down Baltimore street with fixed bayonets as usual, turning people and vehicles into side streets, when three young men who were talking together on the curb refused to move on and clear the way for the procession. A charge was made upon them and they were forced to flee around the nearest corner. As they went several of the negroes fired a volley at them and, one of the young men, a son of a well-known German citizen fell dead. He was shot through the heart. It turned out that he was a Republican in politics and had been a great friend of the negroes. They alleged that he threw a stone into the ranks of the procession but this was positively denied by every bystander. The funeral of the young German was the occasion of a large popular demonstration. Public indignation long since aroused by the offensiveness of the colored military organizations found voice in a general demand for their immediate suppression. As the negroes were in a certain sense under Federal protection, this was a difficult matter to accomplish.\nThe Police Board, however, made an order forbidding public parades through the streets by any military organization not connected with the National Guard or National Government. When this order was read in the meeting places of the colored companies it was received with hoots and jeers of derision. The night that the order was issued, learning that the negroes were about to parade as usual, Marshal Gray sent to the headquarters of the “Lincoln Guard,” the “crack” company of the city, and warned them not to parade. Captain Delanty was laughed at when he delivered the order, and his voice drowned by the howls of the negroes.\nHe then stood outside of the building with his policemen. The negroes formed in the street but at the first step they took after the captain gave the order to march the police rushed up and arrested a large number of them. The others ran back into the building. The police sent those they had captured to the station house. They then entered the building and after a short struggle captured the arms of the remainder. Their muskets gone and their leaders in jail, the militiamen became disheartened and broke up their company.\n[tweet 592102034935013376 align=‘center’]\nOn learning the fate of their principal company, a number of other organizations surrendered their arms, and in the course of a few months practically all the muskets formerly used by the negro troops had been captured by the police. The arms were afterward sent to Fort McHenry, as they were the property of the United States.\n\nSource: Folsom, De Francias.

Photograph by Patrick Joust, April 2010 via Flickr.\n\n\n\nI’ve been spending some time worrying over issues of transparency and participation in public humanities projects like historic designations and other writing about neighborhood history. Instead of hiding my work until I complete the “finished product” - whether that is a National Register nomination or a walking tour program - I’m interested in making more of my work public, visible and subject to feedback and criticism throughout the process. This idea is inspired in part by the concept of “open notebook science” and I’m curious to see how it works for me as a scholar and practitioner.\nAt the moment, I’m working on a National Register Historic District Nomination for the neighborhood of Midtown Edmondson. I met last night with a group of neighborhood residents who are volunteering to support the project and provide feedback on the draft nomination. One neighbor recalled the Super Pride location at W.Lafayette Avenue and N. Payson Street and asked that a history of the store be included. Here is my first draft of a short summary - I’ll likely update the post if I have any corrections or additions:\n\nSuper Pride was established by Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt “Super Jet Market” located on East Chase Street. Renaming the business Super Pride, he restored the business to profitability within three years despite the challenge of some food companies that refused to work with a black-owned store. Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court Chain of Ethical Pharmacies - a business that according to Burns’ obituary, “catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.”\nBetween 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city’s shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.\nSources: Charles T.

    "text": "Formed in 1880, the League of American Wheelmen worked throughout the late-19th century advocating for road improvements, fighting for the right of cyclists to use public roads, and promoting bike racing as a sport. Baltimore boasted a large community of cyclists in the 1880s and 1890s and played host to the League’s annual Convention in 1888 and 1896. On a warm July evening in 1894, the Maryland Division of the League of American Wheelmen lined up at Druid Lake for an evening parade through the streets of Baltimore:\n\n\n\n\nLeague of American Wheelmen, Baltimore, 1888. Courtesy Beverly\n\n\n“‘Line up,’ ‘Fall in by twos,’ ‘Don’t jam,’ and then the parade of the Maryland Division, League of American Wheelmen, was off.\nThe route of the parade was Eutaw Place to Eutaw street, to Monument, to Charles, to Chase street, to Broadway, to Canton avenue and return by the same route. Some of the wheelmen came up Baltimore street on the return trip, but the larger part of the parade returned by Mt. Vernon Pace. … The largest contingents of riders came from the Harlem Wheelmen captained by George Kugler, the Maryland Bicycle Club led by Captain A.L. McMormick and the Baltimore Cycling Club, with 60 riders, led by Captain E.R. Folger. Bike clubs from across the city - Centaur, Clifton, the Young Men’s Christian Association, Patapsco, Riverside, and the Junior Order United American Mechanics - joined the parade. … When the cyclists were ready there was a wavering of the crescent of lamps far out at the east end of the lake. As Chief Consul Albert Mott, who commanded as marshal, came down the line he was received with applause. Club after club fell into line on the right and whizzed past the waiting cyclists on the left.\nAs Consul Mott went through the Eutaw Place gate after the start he had nearly a thousand wheelmen at his back, and a half-dozen wheelwomen too, who were not to be outdone by their male comrades. The ladies rode to the finish.\nThe riders passed through large crowds of spectators on each side as they went through the streets and responded to the applause by giving club yells, tooting syren whistles and jingling several bells that sounded as if they had done service as cowbells in the country.”\n\n[googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&msid=201251479367009811123.0004d89b171e64b722da0&ie=UTF8&t=p&ll=39.300432,-76.616936&spn=0.043172,0.085659&z=13&output=embed&w=525&h=325]\nI’ve traced the route described in the account from The Sun (available through ProQuest) and included some suggested detours that Baltimore’s one-way streets demand.

    "section": "Managing Baltimore’s Post-War Decline",
    "text": "Managing Baltimore’s Post-War Decline\nI was quite excited about this panel, with my own particular interest on dealing with the consequences of abandonment, commercial disinvestment and concentrated poverty in West Baltimore neighborhoods. The first two panelists– Lynette Boswell, University of Maryland College Park and Karen Beck Pooley, Allentown Redevelopment Authority– took a similar approach focusing on the succession of public policies, what Boswell referred to as “place-based” policies in her paper Historical Shifts in Place Based Policies: A Focus on Baltimore, Maryland, from the “Baltimore Plan” an early housing plan under then Mayor Theodore McKeldin (documented in the 1953 short film by the same name) to federal urban renewal policies, model cities and up through HOPE VI and even Healthy Neighborhoods with Pooley’s paper Planning for Vacancy: Baltimore’s Response to Vacant Properties from WWII to the Present. With both papers, however, I really wanted a deeper consideration of the political and racial dimensions of the public policies they reviewed, along with a more critical treatment of the government reports and press accounts that served as a basis for  both presentations. For example, Boswell used a 1937 HOLC Residential Security Map of Baltimore to identify historically “distressed” neighborhoods but did not address the widely acknowledged racism of the HOLC’s mapping practices. Similarly the Baltimore Plan, which Pooley discussed in detail, was later used by the National Asso­ci­a­tion of Real Estate Boards, the National Asso­ci­a­tion of Home Builders, and the Mort­gage Bankers’ Asso­ci­a­tion as the basis for a campaign to eliminate support for public housing. Using more diverse sources or offering examples of contemporary scholar critiques of Baltimore development and housing policies could have provided a more complete review of these same issues.\nWith these concerns in mind, Hayward ‘Woody’ Farrar’s paper The Devolution of the Black Community’s Physical Environment in Baltimore, 1950-2010 offered a dramatic counterpoint with a personal and dynamic presentation that started with a brief emotional reflection on the tragic character of Baltimore’s widespread abandonment. Farrar, the author of The Baltimore Afro-American, 1892-1950, continued to reflect on the dramatic changes to the segregated black neighborhoods of West Baltimore, where a class diverse community helped foster leaders such as Thurgood Marshall and Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson in the early 20th century. Farrar attributed the loss of these neighborhoods as they were in part to urban renewal, referencing Root Shock: How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America, and What We Can Do About It by Mindy Fullilove.\nThe comments by Kelly Quinn, Miami University of Ohio were helpful in pulling the three papers together with an additional reference to How Racism Takes Place by George Lipsitz as a welcome addition to the issues raised in all three papers."

I came late and missed “Our Domestic Vietnam:” Baltimore’s Highway War and the Discovery of a New Urban Regime presented by Rob Gioielli, University of Cincinnati, Blue Ash College but I expect I could get a sense of it from the Baltimore chapter in his dissertation Hard Asphalt and Heavy Metals: Urban Environmentalism in Postwar America. The next paper, A Nice Place to Visit and I Would Want to Live There: Tourism and the ‘Liveable City’ in Baltimore’s Inner Habor Redevelopment from Aaron Cowan, Slippery Rock University (similarly drawn from his dissertation “A Nice Place To Visit: Tourism, Urban Revitalization, and the Transformation of Postwar American Cities”) was packed with interesting surprises on the early history of the Harbor Place development – most notably its role as an important gathering place for b-boys and MCs in the early 1980s. Cowan quoted from Bret McCabe’s 2009 City Paper interview with MC Labtekwon:\n\n“In the ’80s, I grew up in Whitelock City in West Baltimore. I was a black kid on a skateboard that liked to rap. I would go to the Harborplace, Club Cignel, and Club Fantasy and meet up with kids from all over Baltimore City and Baltimore County. It was always an adventure.”\n\nThe final paper of the panel – O Pioneers! Urban Identities in Baltimore’s Homesteading Program of the 1970s from Shana M. Gass, Towson University – was an effective introduction to what is often better known as Baltimore’s dollar house program. Gass’s interpretation of the dollar house program reflected some of the racial and class tensions emphasized out in contemporary press accounts."

Chaired by William Chan, now an Assistant Professor of Architecture, Morgan State University, co-panelists included Sidney Wong, Assistant Professor of Urban Planning, Morgan State University, Art Cohen, Principal of Public Health Services, Martin Millspaugh, former Chairman of Inner Harbor/Charles Center Management and author of the The Human Side of Urban Renewal: A Study of the Attitude Changes Produced by Neighborhood Rehabilitation, William Hellman, a former Maryland Secretary of Transportation (1984-1987), and Al Barrie, former Deputy Planning Director of Baltimore.\nWith this large group, many of the panelists did not have a chance to say much but did offer a small window into the odd dynamics of the 1970s highway fights nearly 40 years ago. At one point, William Chan reflected on the impossible challenge of preparing a “sensitive” urban design for an elevated highway proposed to run straight through the Fell’s Point neighborhood, just a few feet from the front steps of late 1700s and early 1800s rowhouses. Art Cohen, who remains an enthusiastic transportation activist with b’more mobile, shared his own reflections on the unique conditions that led to the success of the highway revolts, including the role of the civil rights movement in enabling new interracial coalitions and a popular anger following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr."

    "text": "Over a year ago, I organized and led a bike tour of Civil War history in West Baltimore for my work Baltimore Heritage. In researching the history of Fort No. 1, an earthen fortification on West Baltimore Street where Bon Secours Hospital is located today, I turned up an unexpected story under the modest headline “Flag presentation.”\nOn the evening of July 20, 1863, a little less than a month after U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton’s General Order 143 created the U.S. Colored Troops, a group of free black laborers assembled to present an American flag to a group of Union troops including two companies of black Union soldiers led by Colonel William Birney. The account of the ceremony in The Baltimore Sun recorded speeches by Col. Birney and Col. Donn Piatt and opens a window onto a truly unique moment in our local and national history as people in Baltimore, both black and white, witnessed the emancipation of enslaved people and saw them armed to fight against the Confederacy. I’ve shared a full excerpt of the account below with a handful of photos to help illustrate the scene.\n\n\n\nFort Number 1. West Defences of Baltimore, Md. 1863. Image courtesy Brown University Library.\n\n\n\nFlag presentation - Yesterday evening about 6 o’clock, the colored laborers who have been working on the various fortifications assembled at fort No. 1, (Fort Davis,) situated near Stuart’s place, on Baltimore street extended, for the purpose of presenting to the military authorities a national flag, which they had purchased to be placed on the above manned fort. Two companies of Col. Birney’s colored regiment were present, as were also two companies of the Fifth New York Battery. Gen. Milroy and staff were present, also nearly all the members of Major Gen. Schenck’s staff. Col. Birney made the presentation on behalf of the colored laborers, and Col. Donn Piatt, on the part of the government, received the flag.\n\nColonel Piatt – In behalf of the colored laborers on this fort, I have the honor to present to you, for the United States, the flag whose folds are now, for the first time, given to the breeze. It is a token of gratitude from men who, after having been long outlawed from our civilization, have been allowed to hope they have at last a country. Who that is not one of them can tell how deep and fervent is that sentiment! With what grateful love they turn to that banner which whispers to them hope and trust in God! To know it fully one must have himself felt the unutterable yearning for deliverance which for two centuries has filled with its agony the hearts of the laboring men of Maryland.\n\n\n\nPortrait of Brig. Gen. Robert Huston Milroy, officer of the Federal Army. Image courtesy Library of Congress.\n\n\nIt did seem to them that God had forgotten that they were cast out from His mercy to be trodden under foot of men. The heavens were overcast with the thickening signs of a coming rebellion, but there was no bow of hope for the slave. Stormy words of menace swelled high on every breeze from the South but the hardy Northern mariner would not hear them in the blinding mist of the ocean; the lumberman did not cease his swift blows on the mountain oak, or the merchant to pore over his ledger, or the farmer to drive his plow, and the politician laughed at the speeding calamity as a sixty days’ bubble. – But God that sitteth in the heavens remembered. He meant to teach this nation. Victory was not a perch upon our banners, the plague was not to e stayed, until the unclean thing was put out of the camp. The inexorable logic of events produced the proclamation of freedom by President Lincoln; and colored men, both free and slaves, thanked God. It was then their hearts were wedded to the stars and stripes.\nThe flag they present you to-day is in token of their loyalty. Their hearts are true. Whoever else may be swayed from duty, the black remains firm. Pluck him from the very core of rebeldom, and he is a true man. You may trust him. All his aspirations are for the sake – of the right – the triumph of the nation. For his, the success of traitors is his own degradation, the dishonor of his family, the doom of his race to perpetual infamy.\nYou may regard, sir, the presentation of this flag as implying the readiness of the men of color to defend it. You have witnessed their alactricity in springing to the lines of these fortifications when Baltimore was menaced, their cheerfulness in volunteering their labor, their patience in its prosecution. These forts around the city will be monuments to their patriotism. With equal alactricity, sir, do they respond to the call of the country “to arms.” When the Goddess of American Liberty hands them the musket, they accept it with stalwart and ready arms, thankful to Providence that their frugal diet has prepared them for the soldier’s rations, that their life of continuous labor in the open air has inured them in advance to the hardships of campaigning, and that they have not now to learn patience and obedience, those two virtues of the soldier.\n\n\n\nUnidentified African American soldier in Union uniform with wife and two daughters. This image was found in Cecil County, Maryland, making it likely that this soldier belonged to one of the seven U.S.C.T. regiments raised in Maryland.

They feel that their zeal will meet with the approval of the good men of this city and country: that the men who are saved from the perils of war by their devotion, will protect their wives and children when they are absent. They confide their little ones, so dear to them, to the honor of the citizens of Baltimore. Their dearest hope is that this war may give them an opportunity to vindicate their manhood; that when the blood of the white man and the black shall mingle on the same fields, for the same holy cause, they may clasp hands over the grave of buried animosities and wrongs, having together achieved Liberty and Union, now and forever one and inseparable.\n\n\n\n\nCol. Donn Piatt. Image courtesy Library of Congress.\n\n\nColonel Don Piatt, chief of Gen. Schenck’s staff, responded as follows:\nIn the name of the Eighth Army Corps of the Middle Department I accept this beautiful flag, purchase with the hard earnings of the workmen, to adorn the fort their hard labor erected.\nIn recognizing he fact I feel deeply that this is no ordinary presentation. Given and accepted as the banner is, I see an epoch in the history of our flag. Heretofore it has been the emblem of our power. Hereafter it will be that and the emblem of humanity as well. In the past it has carried in its folds only a portion of our Declaration of Independence; now it emblazons to the world every sacred word of that immortal instrument.\nThese are the closing scenes of our revolution. What our fathers began we hasten to complete. Our first act, achieved our independence as a nation. This, the last act, proclaims the independence of the man. This plan, running through a complicated chain of grave events, is evident to the thoughtful mind. It is the design of the Almighty. We have been tried, chastened, humbled, and, let me hope, with evidence before me, not found wanting.\nWho could believe that the Divine hand that held through long centuries this vast continent an unbroken solitude, that on it at last the oppressed of all nations should find a refuge and a home; who guided the frail bark of Columbus to its destination.; sustained the pilgrims, and wrought almost miracles for our revolutionary forefathers; who, I ask, could believe that this interposition was made in behalf of a people to be known only as cunning workers in wood and iron, whose flag should represent only a vast accumulation of worldly wealth – a wealth built upon human misery – to accomplish which we had gravely announced through our highest tribunals to the world that we had four millions of subjects lying outside the sympathies of our people who had no rights a government was bound to respect? The man who could believe that is an infidel of the meaner sort, whose poor brain is in keeping with his barren heart.\nIt was not so designed. The Almightly has written upon all his works that a lie cannot live, and truth alone is immortal. The plague spot had to extirpated, or our people die with it. Through the long years of this apparently peaceful prosperity the South was rapidly relapsing into savage barbarism, while at the North manhood was silently being sucked from our hearts.\nWe had extended our dominion from sea to sea; we had changed the song of the wild bird to the busy hum of human life; we had built great cities, peopled vast solitudes, and spread the canvas of our commerce over every seal and all this while we were sinking our spiritual nature and driving the heroic from our souls.\nThe war was a necessity. We had attempted to live down the edicts of the Almighty and the hand of death was on us. Thomas Jefferson had written that all men were born equal, and in the prophetic agony of his great soul he foretold ruin to his people for the attempt to deny what God had decreed. Better this fearful war, better these dark fields of carnage, better the ruined homestead and wide-spread desolation, than a life of dishonor, where decay comes in advance of death, and we move and crawl in sickening rottenness.\nSave that we may go through the fiery ordeal and come out purified, let us take no credit to ourselves. The course of human events written of by Jefferson moves on beyond our control. We cannot change and, above all, we cannot stop their march, or take in our own hangs our destiny. I read of a German who, being shown the Rhine near its source, put his huge foot across the rivulet, and as he dammed the stream remarked to his companions, “won’t they wonder down there when it ceases to run.” So, now, other simple minded men are putting their feet in this stream of events, and are expecting that the great river below will cease to run.\nThis flag presentation, the first in the history of this war, happens fortunately in Baltimore. On this spot it has a strange significance. Here was first composed the great national hymn to our banner that must go ringing down the aisles of time, so long as its stars and stripes are beautiful in our eyes, and its blood-stained folds dear to out memories. Here in Baltimore, the flag has associations dearer, purer and sweeter than elsewhere. Here we have brave hearts and stout arms to defend it, and here, above all places, then, is the spot to fling it out brighter and dearer for the truths it again promulgates.\n\nAfter the speeches a salute of thirty-six guns were fired, cheers given, and the crowd dispersed.\nExcerpted from LOCAL MATTERS The Sun (1837-1987); Jul 21, 1863; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Baltimore Sun, The (1837-1987) pg. 1.

    "text": "Quick post on the demolition of the House of Welsh, more recently known as Club One. This set of three 1830s rowhouses, covered in formstone and isolated at the corner of a large surface parking lot, was demolished on December 3\nBaltimore Skyline has a summary of a 1998 Baltimore Sun feature on the history of the building and a good set of photos from the demolition.\n\nWhen Club One was the House of Welsh\nSo Long Club One\nMore Club One Demo in Photos\n\nDan Rodricks dedicated his December 5 column to the building’s history and its role in fighting the 1904 fire– In rubble of tavern turned club, a remembrance.\n\nOver the weekend, a demolition crew turned One, a chic night club for most of the last decade, into a pile of brick, broken cinderblock and sand. If you’re of a certain age and missed One’s run as a nightclub, you will know this location, at Guilford Avenue and Saratoga Street, as House of Welsh Corner. Instead of big dance floors and theatrically-lighted bars stocked with Dom Perignon, you’ll think of a classic Baltimore tavern that served sizzling steaks on metal plates and Maryland whiskey at a bar without stools.\nIf you’re of a certain age, or paid attention to local history, you might also appreciate a story associated with this tough, old corner of the city. It was the location of what I’d call “communications heroics” from the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, and you might even join with me in suggesting that the next developer of this real estate, along with the Communications Workers of America, put up a small plaque so that those heroics might be remembered.\nThree rowhouses, built in the 1830s, made up the House of Welsh. It opened around 1900 and, by the time it closed nearly a century later, it was said to have the city’s oldest liquor license. In his obituary for the tavern in 1998, my Sun colleague Jacques Kelly wrote that the House of Welsh sat “out the back door of City Hall and attracted politicians, lobbyists, bookmakers, lawyers, policemen, judges and reporters who wanted plain, tasty food served in an unhurried manner.” I once saw a home movie of the elevated train tracks that carried street cars over Guilford Avenue, between Biddle Street and House of Welsh Corner, until 1950. The bar was males-only and whites-only until the 1960s.\nIt’s what happened in 1904 that gets the plaque.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2011,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {House of {Welsh} Demolished on {December} 3},\n  date = {2011-12-07},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-12-07-house-of-welsh-demolished-on-december-3},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2011. “House of Welsh Demolished on December\n3.” December 7, 2011. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-12-07-house-of-welsh-demolished-on-december-3."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Yesterday, I had the opportunity to present a paper at the Society for Historical Archaeology 2012 Annual Meeting about my work with Dr. Dave Gadsby on Civil War Archaeology in Lafayette Square. For more on Dave’s past work, check out Hampden Heritage — a blog about his archaeological research with Dr. Bob Chidester and other collaborators in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore. Careful readers may notice some overlap with my paper for the American Studies Association meeting back in October. I re-used a few passages that I thought worked well in that paper but I think there is enough new material in this one to make it a novel piece.\nOver the past two years with Baltimore Heritage, I’ve worked to connect historic preservation and neighborhood revitalization in the historic neighborhoods of West Baltimore. Baltimore Heritage is a historic preservation advocacy nonprofit established in 1960. We’re a small group, two and a half staff supported by membership and programs. My own position began in fall of 2009 with support from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, to focus on African American heritage city-wide, support matched by grants from the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative requiring us to focus our efforts in support transit-oriented community development in an area of West Baltimore proposed for as the location of a new east-west light rail route known as the Red Line.\nAs part of this broader effort, I worked this past summer with Dr. David Gadsby, Brandon Bies and a great group of volunteers from the Archaeological Society of Maryland to conduct an archeological investigation of Lafayette Barracks—a Civil War camp and hospital located within the boundaries of Lafayette Square park, at the heart of an area known as Old West Baltimore. West Baltimore is not necessarily an obvious place to conduct an archeological investigation or to build connections between heritage and neighborhood revitalization. I often encounter questions from both residents — and, perhaps even more often, people who live outside these neighborhoods — asking why we should bother with preserving or interpreting the history of neighborhoods and communities, whose struggles with abandonment, addiction, disinvestment and violence seem to overwhelm any other concerns? While I can’t put this question aside, I can continue with a perhaps more optimistic thought – how can our shared heritage be used to build better neighborhoods and better lives for West Baltimore residents? Further, what is the place of public archeology in this effort?\n\n\n\nCivil War Archeology in Lafayette Square\n\n\nThough such efforts are often minimized in favor of the higher priority on “removing blight” or attracting investment into downtown (and always constrained by limited funds), preservation and archeology in Baltimore have an urgent responsibility to connect cultural heritage to diverse communities in ways that go beyond interpreting the past or even highlighting the origins of the city’s persistent inequalities, but to effectively empower residents in pursuit of neighborhood revitalization that respects their own histories. Our work with public archaeology in Lafayette Square began two years ago, when I first approached Dr. Gadsby to ask how we might be able to use archaeology to learn a bit more about the occupation of the park during the Civil War. My quick bar napkin sketch of the area must have been credible enough to convince Dave to come out on a site visit a few months later on a snowy January and then pass his enthusiasm along to Dr. Charles Hall from the Maryland Historical Trust a few months later. We applied for and received a Survey and Inventory grant from the Archaeological Society of Maryland in late 2010 and scheduled our investigation for mid-summer 2011.\nThe project felt all the more urgent in the context of the national and local commemoration of the Civil War Sesquicentennial that seemed ready to take the stories of the B&O Railroad, the Pratt Street Riot, and wealthy, Confederate-sympathizing spies in Mount Vernon as the only stories worth telling. Such choices have consequences for who participates in the interpretation of Baltimore’s history and where that interpretation takes place, likely excluding segregated black, low-income neighborhoods like Lafayette Square. Writer and Baltimore native Ta-Nehisi Coates recently reflected on a similar point in a recent NPR interview on how African Americans have been excluded from the interpretation of the Civil War through Lost Cause mythologies. Coates remarked that, “one of the most depressing things [he] found,” was when a tour guide at the Gettysburg Battlefield park told him, “‘You can sit there for hours — and you can count on one hand the number of African-Americans that come into the battle park.’” In The Atlantic magazine, Coates describes how the “country’s battlefields are marked with the enduring evidence” of the “tireless efforts” by Confederate descendants to present their own story of the Civil War—a story that, despite their defeat in the conflict, erased their ancestors complicity with the system of slavery that Confederate troops had fought for and died trying to preserve. Here in Baltimore, the monuments to Confederacy are one of the city’s most visible daily reminders of the war. Just this past summer, the Maryland’s United Daughters of the Confederacy held a ceremony on Confederate Memorial Day at Baltimore’s Loudon Park Cemetery to honor the 600 Confederate veterans buried there. No memorial exists to honor the free blacks who built Fort No. 1 on West Baltimore Street to protect the city (and encampments like Lafayette Barracks) from Confederate attack. No annual ceremony is held to recognize the hundreds of enslaved men who enlisted in the U.S. Colored troops, mustering at Camp Birney in West Baltimore’s Druid Hill Park.\nLafayette Barracks was located in Lafayette Square Park from 1861 through 1865, housing up to 1,000 soldiers at a time, and was just one camp within a broader ring of fortifications, hospitals and encampments that fed and sheltered soldiers moving in and out of Baltimore during the war. Our initial documentary research, by myself and my colleague Lauren Schiszik, turned up encouraging references that opened a window on the daily life of 1860s West Baltimore—stories of escaped slaves from the Eastern Shore sheltered by Union troops at the camp, stories of violence between soldiers and residents, stories that we hoped might be made all the more visceral through the use of archaeology. Public archaeology built on our continued efforts to explore and interpret complex histories of segregation, urban renewal and civil rights in West Baltimore and provided the basis to expand the visibility of our organizing effort with the Friends of West Baltimore Squares—a new partnership-based West Baltimore organizing and outreach effort we started last spring.\nThe investigation began on Friday, July 8 with our group of Archaeological Society of Maryland volunteers establishing a grid to guide the location of shovel test pits and the metal detector survey. We started a few shovel test pits that afternoon and began the metal detector survey working along the grid. On Saturday, we expanded the number of shovel test pits, working from east to west along the southern edge of the park where we believed camp activities would have been focused. We also opened up the two units–small square excavations–along the western edge of the park. Finally, on Sunday we concluded the excavation with additional shovel test pits and completing both units.\n\n\n\nUnion officer’s jacket button, Civil War Archeology in Lafayette Square\n\n\nWe recovered a range of 20th and 19th century artifacts including several items that are clearly associated with the Civil War occupation of the park. These latter artifacts include tin buttons from the trousers or underwear of Union soldiers, a button from the dress jacket of a Maryland Union officer, and a small piece of lead shot. Other 19th century artifacts included a pipe stem, many pieces of ceramic, fragments of decorative cast-iron work, brick and coal. The presence of numerous cut or wrought-iron nails in the park is a clear indicator of the structures historically located in that area.\nOver the long three day weekend, we had over 250 visitors to the site, including scores of neighborhood residents, local church members on Sunday, Baltimore Heritage members, and even the head of the Baltimore City Department of Planning. On Saturday alone, we had about 160 individuals participate in one of our five walking tours around the site and we gave away around 140 hotdogs to visitors and volunteers. We provided a range of interpretation including opportunities to talk with archeologists and volunteers, a 2005 outdoor exhibit produced by Baltimore Heritage on the social and architectural history of Lafayette Square, a temporary exhibit on the President Street Station set up by volunteers from the Baltimore Civil War Museum, and a brochure explaining the process of urban historical archaeology, the Civil War context of the site and the history of the community in the 20th century.\nWe’ve had several subsequent opportunities to continue extending the discussion around Lafayette Barracks—offering a special tour to a group of young people from the nearby Macedonia Baptist Church during the excavation and following up with the same group to present a talk about the artifacts we recovered; a presentation on the investigation to the Department of Recreation and Parks Advisory Board; tabling at Lafayette Square Block Party just a month after the dig with a box of artifacts in hand; presenting to local Civil War enthusiasts through a lecture series at the nearby Mt. Clare House Museum; and starting the planning for a follow-up presentation in the community once we have completed processing and analyzing the artifacts.\nWe have also connected the investigation to a range of other projects where we’re seeking to engage African American audiences around the Civil War Sesquicentennial, including a walking tour about the history of Frederick Douglass in Fell’s Point and a lecture program on how the National Trust for Historic Preservation is working to expand and improve the interpretation of enslavement at historic sites around the country. In November, we organized a West Baltimore Civil War bike tour that connected visitors to encampments and significant historic places across the area with a role in the Civil War—Mt. Clare Mansion and Camp Carroll, the site of Lafayette Barracks, and the B&O Railroad Museum. This latter program had an additional advantage of building new relationships with local bike planners and advocates who are working to expand cycling infrastructure in West Baltimore communities.\nThis project was also an important accomplishment the Friends of West Baltimore Squares—a relatively new community organizing effort that we started in partnership with the Parks & People Foundation and a number of community organizations around Lafayette Square, nearby Harlem Park, Franklin Square, and Union Square to encourage the use and recognition of parks and heritage as important assets for community development. Through events and outreach—barbeques, volunteer events at local gardens and walking tours (highlighting history and sustainable storm water management)—we’ve grown a contact list of nearly 400 residents and stakeholders that are interested in staying engaged in West Baltimore neighborhoods. The strong turnout by residents and visitors for our archaeological investigation is both a reflection of our continued work to engage area residents and an important building block in establishing our credibility as a partner who can create valuable opportunities for local residents to meet neighbors and discuss both the past and the future of their communities.\nThrough these experiences we’ve settled on a set of guiding principles for our outreach work that clearly mirror the values of activist public archeology laid out by Dr. Gadsby and other practitioners within the field.\n\nWe are dedicated to a usable past that seeks out histories of development, struggle, and organizing that offer tools to better understand contemporary concerns.\nWe embrace difficult stories, recognizing the importance of stories around enslavement, civil rights, racism and urban renewal to shaping the history of these neighborhoods and continuing to engage residents and visitors at a visceral level.\nWe don’t work alone. Our research and interpretation seeks to engage residents and other stakeholders in the interpretation of local history and the development of tours.\n\nEven with modest expectations, it is challenging to evaluate the true effectiveness of these or any efforts that seek to use heritage to support neighborhood revitalization. We’re two and a half staff, a small grant here and there, up against decades of disinvestment and economic inequality. However, I agree with Dave writing in Archaeology in Society, p.72 that the “primary obstacle” for public archeology (and historic preservation) “lies in the need to convince local residents of the relevance of history and heritage for their lives.” Ned Kaufman, a long time director of historic preservation for the Municipal Art Society of New York, offers his own support for this view in Place, Race, and Story: essays on the past and future of historic preservation, writing–\n\n“History offers a way to establish a presence within the public space of political and cultural discourse–and without presence one can hardly hope for leverage. History can’t provide adequate housing, end discrimination or prevent redevelopment, but it can contribute to the debate that is necessary to achieving these goals.”\n\nWith patience and many new partnerships, I hope we are starting to make the case this is true.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Society for {Historical} {Archaeology} 2012: {Interpreting}\n    the {Past,} {Building} a {Future} Through {Archaeology} in\n    {Lafayette} {Square}},\n  date = {2012-01-07},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-01-07-society-for-historical-archaeology-2012-interpreting-the-past-building-a-future-through-archaeology-in-lafayette-square},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “Society for Historical Archaeology 2012:\nInterpreting the Past, Building a Future Through Archaeology in\nLafayette Square.” January 7, 2012. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-01-07-society-for-historical-archaeology-2012-interpreting-the-past-building-a-future-through-archaeology-in-lafayette-square."

    "text": "This is the first part of the draft of a paper I’m working on about the politics of Project CORE and the history of demolition in Baltimore. Comments or suggestions are welcome! You can also see the photos and links I’ve been collecting for this project using the hashtag #baltimoredemolition on Twitter and Instagram.\nAbout a week ago, on March 27, 2018, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan held a press conference in front of six boarded-up vacant houses on the 1000 block of N. Stockton Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Built between 1886 and 1896, the two-story houses had been slated for demolition for over a year with funding from Project CORE, a state program created to expand the demolition of vacant buildings in Baltimore City.1 Hogan used the occasion to announce the newest phase of Project CORE: the planned demolition of five hundred more abandoned buildings that Pugh claimed in a joint statement “provide a haven for criminal activity in neighborhoods most at risk.”\nIn his speech, Hogan described plans to tear down “decaying and dangerous properties in the highest violent crime areas where the most criminal gang activity is occurring,” suggesting that the city had “designated and prioritized” the targeted vacant buildings as “a contributing factor to violent crime in those communities.” He observed that “vacant and blighted structures too often contribute to the sale and use of illegal drugs and other criminal gang activity” but demolition, together with increased support from state police and proposed legislation to doubling the minimum sentence for repeat felonies involving a gun can improve public safety in Sandtown-Winchester. Hogan then got behind the controls of a John Deere 450D excavator and, with help from a contractor, started tearing down those six houses on Stockton Street.\nPugh offered a similar message when she shared a video of the demolition on Twitter, writing: “We are taking them down so that we can build-up our communities. Our citizens and young people deserve this and so much more.” The city’s recently drafted Baltimore Green Network Plan proposed replacing the vacant houses on Stockton Street and nearby blocks with Smithson Park. The city plans to work with neighborhood residents, represented by the Sandtown South Neighborhood Alliance and the Western District Community Relations Council, to find funding, design, and build the new neighborhood park.2 Smithson Park is one of several pilot projects the plan sketched out for west Baltimore neighborhoods Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, Druid Heights, and Upton.\nOnline reactions to the announcement varied. Laura Baile responded to a video of Hogan’s announcement on Twitter: “Great news. Too many junkies hang out in those abandoned Townhomes and Rob people.” Sander Mednick responded to Pugh: “Start boasting when you actually build something useful. Until then this is much ado about nothing… a rat relocation program.”\nThe idea that tearing down buildings improves public safety and reduces crime isn’t unique to Baltimore. A handful of recent examples—Detroit, Michigan in 2010, Camden, New Jersey in 2015, and Chicago, Illinois in 2016—illustrate the recent enthusiasm of elected officials for demolition. About eight years ago, on March 23, 2010, Detroit’s mayor Dave Bing made the case for demolition in his first State of the City address:\nBy April, the city had started work on the demolition of an initial group of one thousand vacant houses selected by the city’s Police, Fire and Buildings & Safety Engineering departments using 2009 arson and crime statistics.3\nIn 2015, Camden’s mayor Dana Redd spoke at the demolition of 1510 Louis Street making a similar case:\nRedd shared the plan to remove six hundred houses using funding from the city, Community Development Block Grant program, and a public bond issue.5\nIn 2016, Chicago Alderman Carrie Austin stood in front of a demolition site on the 200 block of West 113th Street and explainined how residents asked her to “beg the city to take them down.” She said demolition would strengthen the community:\nThis recent surge in connecting demolition to policing and public safety predated the beginning of the national foreclosure crisis in late 2007. Vacant Properties: The True Costs to Communities, an influential 2005 publication by the National Vacant Properties Campaign (established in 2002 by Smart Growth America), sought to help planners and elected officials understand “the many and varied costs that vacant and abandoned properties impose upon communities” by gathering quantitative research on costs associated with city services (nuisance abatement, crime and fire prevention), decreased property values and tax revenues, and costs to resident home-owners. Crime featured prominently in the list of municipal services but report did not offer any estimates of the “monetary cost” before concluding “it is clear that vacant properties burden police departments.”7 As evidence, the report cited the now infamous “broken windows” theory popularized by criminal justice scholar George Kelling and James Q. Wilson in a 1982 article for The Atlantic.\nTwenty years earlier, Wilson and Kelling argued that, “at the community level, disorder and crime are usually inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence.” They presented vacant buildings not only as potential sites for criminal activity but an enticement for law-breaking:\nWhile many now find this argument suspect, it is important to recognize that proponents of aggressive policing are not the only people calling for the demolition of vacant buildings. Baltimore’s Black residents have a long history of seeking relief from the hazards of vacant buildings concentrated in historically segregated Black neighborhoods.8 It is clear that vacant and abandoned housing is a symptom of broader systemic problems—automobile-centered development and racial segregation foremost among them—but the hazards, financial costs, and stigma largely effect people living nearby.9\nPeople living near vacant buildings worry over their own safety and the safety of their neighbors. Elected officials and city residents find common ground in beautification—making neighborhoods more attractive place for existing residents and people traveling through—and in public health and safety—keeping neighbors safe from poor housing conditions, violent crime, and addiction.\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Edward V. Woods heard demands for demolition from at least one resident on Friday, June 26, 1992 when he visited the 900 block of E. Biddle Street to meet the family of s three-year-old boy, Andre Antonio Dorsey, killed by a stray bullet two days earlier. Regardless of any planned police response, the boy’s mother, Felicia Dorsey, was ready to leave, saying, “Even if the police do try to do something more in the neighborhood, I’m not planning on even staying around to see it. I’m moving.” On a brief walk around the block, Woods met a twenty-year-old neighbor, Denise Lewis, who offered the commissioner some advice: “tear all these rotten houses down and build the kids a playground.”10\nLewis recognized that demolition alone wasn’t enough. Kids in East Baltimore needed safe, well-maintained recreational spaces. But, even as Woods listened with a sympathetic ear, the city’s budget reflected a different set of priorities. In 1992, the city’s Police Department employed 3,594 people (about twenty percent of the city’s total) compared to 803 people employed at the Department of Recreation and Parks (not even five percent of the city’s total). The police had a program budget of $181,695,068—more than five times the $34,052,350 program budget for recreation and parks.11\nTwo decades later, around 2013, East Baltimore residents with Re-Build Johnston Square with organizing support from Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) began advocating for modest improvements in the maintenance of Ambrose Kennedy Park just one block south of the home where Dorsey was killed twenty-five years earlier.12 Ultimately, the advocacy led to a 2016 grant application where the Parks & People Foundation received over $400,000 for the improvement and expansion of the park. In 2017, construction began on the park improvements and, in early 2018, the city began tearing down houses on Eager and Valley Streets.13\nWhile the improvements at Ambrose Kennedy Park are sure to improve the lives of Johnston Square residents, policing, not parks, remains the priority for local elected officials. Between 1992 and 2016, the gap in funding between the Baltimore’s police and parks grew nearly three times over.14 The total number of police employees fell slightly to 3,259—but now made up nearly a quarter of the city’s total employees. Recreation and Parks employed 327 people in 2016—a little over two percent of the city’s total.\nThe limited funding for city parks and the planned expansion of parks under the Green Network Plan suggest that paying for maintenance is going to be an ongoing challenge.15 In addition, not every vacant lot is turned into a park or playground. Whether vacant houses are replaced by parks or vacant lots, does demolition really improve public safety? I believe a sincere commitment to improved public safety in Johnston Square, Sandtown-Winchester, and every Baltimore neighborhood requires a different approach.\nStay tuned for a much deeper history of demolition in Baltimore and more background on the academic research related to public safety, demolition, and parks! Thanks for reading."

    "title": "Before Freddie Gray: A History of Police Violence in Baltimore",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week, a man named Freddie Gray died of injuries received after his arrest by officers of the Baltimore City Police Department. Gray’s death and the ongoing protests have focused local and national media on the violence of police brutality in Baltimore City. Reading stories on the recent history of deaths in police custody, the history of “rough rides” in Baltimore police (both from the Baltimore Sun) and a look back on a decade of police brutality complaints (“The Obscene Culture of Police Brutality”) have helped broaden my understanding of this issue. But when Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Police Union, stated protests that call for the arrest of the officers involved in Freddie Gray’s death “look and sound like a lynch mob” - it is a disturbing reminder that a deeper understanding of American history is essential to reforming an unjust police department. And much of this history is still unwritten.\n\n\n\nFormer Police Department Headquarters, 100 Fallsway. Courtesy Library of Congress.\n\n\nWith all of this in mind, I’ve assembled a selection of accounts reviewing the history of police violence against African Americans in Baltimore from the 1850s through the 1960s. When reading, please remember that this work is both incomplete and in progress. Comments and questions are welcome and I hope to update and expand this post over the next few weeks.\nUpdate: You can now read my draft study on criminal injustice in Baltimore for some broader context on this post.\n\nMarch 1852: William Smith killed by a Baltimore police officer in Pennsylvania\nThe Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 enlisted local and state police in a renewed and expanded campaign to recapture any people who escaped from slavery in the south to free states in the north. Writing in 1883, William T. Alexander observed an “remarkable” growth in the “activity and universality of slave hunting” under the new law. The examples Alexander highlighted included James Hamlet captured in New York City at the request of a Baltimore slave-holder and the murder of William Smith in Pennsylvania by a Baltimore police officer:\n\n“That Act became a law on the 18th of September and, within ten days thereafter, a colored man named James Hamlet had been seized in the city of New York and very summarily dispatched to a woman in Baltimore, who claimed him as her slave. […]\n\n\n“The needless brutality with which these seizures were often made tended to intensify the popular repugnance which they occasioned. In repeated instances, the first notice the alleged fugitive had of his peril was given him by a blow on the head, sometimes with a club or stick of wood; and being thus knocked down, he was carried bleeding and insensible, before the facile commissioner, who made short work of identifying him and earning his ten dollars by remanding him into slavery. In Columbia, Penn., March, 1852, a colored person named William Smith was seized as a fugitive by a Baltimore police officer, while working in a lumber yard, and, attempting to escape the officer drew a pistol and shot him dead.”\n\n\n\nJuly 31, 1875: Daniel Brown killed by Baltimore police officer Patrick McDonald\nIn the early morning hours of Saturday, July 31, 1875, Baltimore Police officer Patrick McDonald shot and killed Daniel Brown at his home on Tyson Street. The Baltimore Sun described the shooting in an account published on August 2:\n\nSaturday morning, shortly before two o’clock, Daniel Brown, colored, of No. 41 Tyson street, was shot in the head by police officer Patrick McDonald, of the northwestern district, and in about half an hour died from the effects of the wound. A party or sociable entertainment was going on in Brown’s house, and complaint of the noise having been made to policeman McDonald, he went to the place. Words were exchanged at the door of the house between the officer outside and the people inside. The result was that Brown was “tapped on the head” by the policeman’s club. The policeman went into the house, and there, it is alleged, shot and killed Brown without provocation. Policeman McDonald on the other hand asserts that the shooting was in self-defense. He avers that he felt his life to be in imminent peril! A coroner’s jury, after examining over a dozen witnesses rendered a verdict that “Daniel Brown came to his death by a pistolshot from the hands of policeman  Patrick McDonald,” and on the commitment of Coroner Ogle the accused was sent to jail by Captain Earhart.\n\nThe initial argument between McDonald and Brown started with McDonald’s demand to see a permit for the party (commonly known as a “cake-walk”). Mary Parker, a resident of 232 North Charles Street, testified “she was in the front room at Brown’s” continuing:\n\n“Brown said he paid rent for the house . The officer said he”need’nt be so — saucy.” Brown had his head out the door. The officer caught Brown and struck him over the head with his club. He staggered and fell toward a closet in the front room. The police now followed his his pistol in his hand and Mrs. Brown behind him, begging him not to shoot. She said, “He is my husband” and the officer, saying he didn’t care a d–n,” fired. Brown never spoke after he was struck on the head. John Greason begged the officer not to shoot. The officer said the would kill every black —.”\n\nThe Baltimore Sun described Brown writing:\n\n“Daniel Brown, the deceased, was a dark mulatto, thirty-seven years of age, and leaves a wife but no children. He was industrious and sober, quite intelligent and strong in urging his own way. In the daytime of late he was employed as a laborer, and occasionally at night worked in Woods, Weeks & Co,’s sugar refinery.”\n\nThe Sun continued to provide detailed coverage of McDonald’s trial from mid to late November. On November 24, 1875, the jury returned the verdict: “Not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.”\n\n\nJuly 19, 1884: Police officer F.L. Kruse shoots and kills John Wesley Green\nOn July 24, 1884, the Baltimore Sun reported:\n\nPolice officer F.L. Kruse, of the  Western district, who shot John Wesley Green, colored in the back and fatally injured him last Saturday night, was exonerated by the police board yesterday, and was patrolling his beat last night. […]\nCommissioners Milroy and Herbert voted to exonerate the officer, Mr. Colton dissenting. Mr. Colton said: “The officer did not see Green commit any offense and he did not have a warrant of law to arrest him. I consider the taking of human life too serious a matter to justify the officer in using his pistol in this case.”\n\n\n\nJune 1, 1918: Baltimore police shoot and kill a “colored man on Pennsylvania avenue”\nOn June 7, 1918, the Afro American reported on a shooting involving multiple Baltimore City police officers that resulted in the death of one man:\n\nThe fatal shooting of a colored man on Pennsylvania avenue by the police last Saturday night and the severe wounding of another, has aroused a great deal of comment this week. It appears that some colored men were disorderly and the police grabbed one. While dragging him to the call box some one hit the policeman with a chair. Despite the crowded condition of Pennsylvania avenue at that time, it is said the police began shooting, with the result that one man lay dead and another seriously wounded. The man killed it is averred by some was not the man who hit the policeman.\nA ban has been placed on pedestrians, and any who stop to talk this Saturday may be arrested. Some of the police, it is alleged are gloating over the killing of the man. They look forward to making a harvest in arrests this [Saturday] night, it is being claimed.\nPennsylvania avenue has been what some call an “indicted street” since the recent large influx from the South and many have been arrested on Saturday nights and charged with loitering.\nA decade ago the police indiscriminately arrested colored men and women who happened to stop even for conversation. They were invariable fined notwithstanding character witnesses appeared the next morning in a number of instances and attested to the good habits on those taken in.\n\n\n\nFebruary 1919: Black soldier brutally beaten by Baltimore police officer\nOn February 16, 1918, the Baltimore Sun praised Judge Stanton for his role in protesting a recent incident of police brutality:\n\n“Judge Stanton has rendered a service in calling the attention of the Police Commissioners to the alleged brutality of a policeman in dealing with a soldier who resisted arrest… In this case, we are sorry to say, the soldier behaved like a rowdy. But, for all that, the policeman who undertook to arrest him was not justified in treating him brutally. He could have managed him, we imagine, without resorting to methods which excited indignation in the minds of spectators. The patrolman was in civilian clothes at the time and the soldier naturally did not recognize his authority.\nDiscretion is a virtue that is as important as valor or as muscle on the part of a police officer. We think the Commissioners should look into this incident carefully.”\n\n\n\nMay 31, 1926: Police officer James O. Jones beats Henry Boyer\nOn June 12, 1926, the Afro-American reported on an efforts by Baptist ministers in Baltimore to protest the actions of Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer, writing:\n\nWhat they termed the most brutal abuse of police authority and wanton disregard for the rights of citizens was brought out in the Monday Baptist Ministers’ meeting when the Rev J.C. Sweeney described the act of Officer James O. Jones beating up Henry Boyer on Winchester street May 31.\nAccording to a version of the affair, as stated by the Rev. Mr. Sweeney and the boy in question, Officer Jones of the Northwestern district used his espantoon on young boyer when he “sassed” him when told to move on from the corner of Stricker and Winchester streets.\nBoyer stated that when he did not move fast enough the officer seized him and he asked that before he was arrested he be allowed to send word to his mother. He was then beaten up until he was “bloody” he declared. At the station house the officer said Boyer “sassed” him and resisted arrest…\nWhen the case was brought up in the Criminal Court Wednesday Judge O’Dunne told the officer that “sassing” an officer would not be considered a disturbance of the public peace in his court. “It might be a disturbance of the peace of the officer, but did not constitute a breach of the law against the public,” he stated. He held the boy’s case under advisement.\nThe practice of beating up citizens and then preferring charges of resisting arrest against them was also discussed by the ministers. It was pointed out that efficient officers were always able to arrest even criminals without the use of their sticks, and that even an amateur officer ought to be able to take a lad to the station house without having to “subdue” him by battering his head up.\nAnother practice which is said to be common among some officers is to mete punishment themselves for things said to them by those they arrest. This punishment is against the law, it is said, and those so treated should take their cases always to the Criminal Court, it was advised.\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 1930: Baltimore police officer Herman Trautner kills Roosevelt Yates\nOn March 22, 1930, the Afro reported on the death of Roosevelt Yates after he was shot and killed by Herman Trautnet in his home at 905 Bennett Place:\n\nPolice here chalked up another victim when Officer Herman Trautner shot and fatally wounded Roosevelt Yates during arrest of the latter at his home, 905 Bennett Place, Monday. [Trautner] shot Roosevelt in the chest after the latter had grabbed the officer’s espantoon before it landed in a blow on his head, it was said. In his report, officer Trautner declared that he shot in self defense when Yates started towards him with the night stick after wresting it from his hand in a struggle.\n\nOn March 29, 1930, the Afro reflect on the killing as a pattern of brutality by the Baltimore police:\n\nBaltimore police killed their eight victim in six years last week when Officer Herman Trautner, white, killed Roosevelt Yates, an unarmed man he was seeking to arrest. Five others had been killed by policemen in fifteen years previously. As a result of these thirteen shootings, only one policeman has been punished. […]\nThe trouble is police brutality in Baltimore has gone as far as some people are going to stand. Men and women are usually willing to be arrested but not clubbed by police. This is especially true as to those persons who are engaged in a mere wordy brawl.\nOf the eight men killed, five have been murdered by police of the Northwestern district, administered by Captain Charles Lastner. As the AFRO has repeatedly pointed out, the difference between the conduct of Baltimore police in the Northwestern district and the Southeastern district is the difference between right and wrong. If police can be gentlemen in southeast Baltimore, they can be gentlemen in the northwestern part of the city.\nEvery unnecessary drop of blood shed by murderous police we place at the doors of, first, Captain Lastner who is responsible for directions given his own men, and secondly, Police Commissioner Gaither who permits Captain Lastner to continue his policy of “shoot first, investigate and explain later.”\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 1930: William Johnson dies after assault by police officer Harry Holley\nOn September 6, 1930, the Afro-American reported on the NAACP protesting to the governor after an assault on William Johnson by police officer Harry Holley left Johnson unconscious for two weeks before dying at the University Hospital:\n\nAt an inquest at the Western police station Thursday night, Officer Harry Holly was exonerated in the killing of William Johnson who died after being struck with a blackjack by the officer. Fourteen witnesses testified that the officer brutally assaulted Johnson without provocation. One white man and the officer testified for the defense.\nThe death of William Johnson, 137 W. Camden Street, on September 1 at University Hospital after being hit with a blackjack by Policeman Harry Holley, white, of the Western district, aroused the city this week.\n\n\n\nFebruary 21, 1942: Police officer Edward R. Bender kills Thomas Broadus\nOn February 7, 1942, the Afro reported on the death of Thomas Broadus after he was shot and killed by Edward R. Bender:\n\n In the presence of scores of persons who were passing along Baltimore’s busy Pennsylvania Avenue late Saturday night, Patrolman Edward Bender, Northwestern district officer, shot and killed Private Thomas Broadus, 26, Pittsburgh, a member of the 1322nd Service Unit at Fort George G. Meade.\nWitnesses said that Patrolman Bender (who is the same policeman that killed Charles Parker, 24, of 217 Colvin Street, February 14, 1940) then keep the crowd at bay by brandishing his revolver until other policeman arrived in several radio cars. The unconscious form of the soldier, drafted nine months ago, was placed in a patrol wagon, witnesses said, and taken to Provident Hospital, where it was pronounced dead five minutes after being admitted.\n\nBy late April of 1942, protests over the shooting sparked Baltimore Civil Rights advocates to organize the March on Annapolis with around 1,800 African Americans traveling to the state capital to protest police brutality and racial discrimination. The march forced the Baltimore police to appoint the city’s first uniformed black police officers and led Governor Herbert R. O’Conor to appoint a statewide Commission on Problems Affecting the Negro Population.\nOn September 25, 1942, the Afro reported that the commission released a report urging the Bender case to be reopened:\n\nCharging that there is prima facie evidence that the killing by Patrolman Edward R. Bender, of the Northwestern district, of a Negro soldier last February “was unlawful,” a subcommittee of the State Commission to Study Colored Problems yesterday recommended the case be resubmitted to the grand jury.\nIn a report highly critical of the administration of Robert F. Stanton as Police Commissioner, the subcommittee also characterized as “unsatifsactory” the handling of the case by J. Bernard Wells, State’s Attorney.\n\n\n\nMay 16, 1946: Wilbur Bundley shot and killed by patrolman Walter J. Weber\nOn June 10, 1946, the Baltimore Sun reported on the organized protests in response to the shooting of Wilbur Bundley by patrolman Walter J. Weber:\n\nCalling for a more militant attitude by the Negroes of Baltimore in the maintenance of their constitutional rights and privileges, speakers at a meeting held in Leadenhall Baptist Church yesterday afternoon charged the city’s police with brutality toward both white and Negro citizens.\nThe speakers who included Leo V. Miller, a white member of the board of Crownsville State Hospital for Negroes, based their charge largely on the death of Wilbur Bundley, Negro, shot fatally on May 19 by Patrolman Walter J. Weber of the Southern district police. […]\nAddison S. Pinkney, executive secretary of the Baltimore branch of the N.A.A.C.P., which, with the Citizens League of South Baltimore, sponsored yesterday’s meeting, said “We believe this case will stop police brutality in Baltimore both against whites and Negroes.”\n“We serve notice on the authorities that we now are acting as a group and not as individuals” […] “This is the first case in the city where the force of the Negro population can be shown,” he added. “This is the best case we ever had.”\n\n\n\nJune 22, 1964: Louis C. Petty dies after beating by police officers Glen Russell and Joseph Mulling\nOn June 23, 1964, the Baltimore Sun reported on the death of Louis C. Petty from injuries following a beating by two Baltimore City police officers:\n\nA 44-year-old man, injured in a scuffle with a policeman Saturday, died last night, bringing demands from a city councilman for an investigation into charges of police brutality and protests from neighbors who witnessed the fray.\nThe patrolman, Glen Russell, of the Southwestern district, was temporarily suspended by Chief Inspector George J. Murphy.\nDelegate Clarence M. Mitchell 3d (D., Fourth), said he had testimony from about fifteen eyewitnesses swearing that Patrolman Russell and Patrolman Joseph Mulling had beaten Louis C. Petty, 44, a Negro, of the 500 block Edgewood street, after they had arrested and handcuffed him. […]\nPetty died of head injuries yesterday afternoon in Franklin Square Hospital.\n\n\n\nJuly 11, 1964: Vernon Leopold shot and killed by William Ray\nOn July 11, 1964, Vernon Leopold was shot and killed by Baltimore police officer William Ray, as the Baltimore Sun reported on July 18:\n\nVernon Leopold, 28, was the Negro shot July 11 by Patrolman William Ray, 31, a veteran of 10 years on the Baltimore force. Police said Ray was attacked by Leopold. The NAACP said Ray provoked Leopold.\n\nOn July 31, the Baltimore Sun reported on the testimony at a preliminary hearing on a charge of homicide against William Ray:\n\nDefense and prosecution witnesses differed sharply yesterday on the question as to whether Patrolman William Ray was drunk July 11 when he shot and killed 28-year-old Vernon Leopold.\nA day-long stream of witnesses poured into an unusual hearing in Central Municipal Court that was partially designed to meet the mounting criticism against secret grand jury hearings of cases involving the use of police force against private citizens during arrests.\n\nWitnesses and police officials who testified notably disagreed on whether William Ray was drunk at the time of shooting and on his role in provoking the  conflict. Charges against William Ray were dismissed on July 31. The Maryland Conference of the NAACP responded by calling for a federal investigation of the Baltimore City Police Department, passing a resolution summarized by the Baltimore Sun on August 2:\n\nStatements made on the character of Negro witnesses during the extraordinary twenty-hour preliminary hearing on homicide charges against Patrolman William Ray were criticized in yesterday’s resolution as: “…a deliberate effort to discredit the entire Negro community by creating the false impression that its leaders are without principle.”\nThe patrolman’s attorney, Paul Berman, in his summation of his case, called the State’s witnesses “murderers, cutthroats, thieves… and now, deliberate, inspired, manufactured perjurers.”\n\n\n\nNotes on research and sources\nIn early 2014, started work on a historic context on Civil Rights and Baltimore’s African American community organized around themes including equitable education, voting rights, and public accommodation. I put together an extensive bibliography of secondary sources but I had difficulty finding any scholarship on the theme of criminal injustice in Baltimore. By February, reflecting on the protests following the grand jury decision in the case of Eric Garner’s death in New York, I decided to pursue additional primary research on this topic. This post is an initial effort to summarizing an ongoing research project. I decided to publish it now because I felt the topic was too urgent to wait until I was able to deliver a more complete or comprehensive take.\nThis post is largely based on accounts published in the Baltimore Sun and Afro-American newspapers accessed through the ProQuest Historical Newspapers database. I’ve published this work independently of my work at Baltimore Heritage but encourage anyone interested to learn more about our Civil Rights historic context project on our website.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Before {Freddie} {Gray:} {A} {History} of {Police} {Violence}\n    in {Baltimore}},\n  date = {2015-04-24},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-04-24-before-freddie-gray-a-history-of-police-violence-in-baltimore},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “Before Freddie Gray: A History of Police\nViolence in Baltimore.” April 24, 2015. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-04-24-before-freddie-gray-a-history-of-police-violence-in-baltimore."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While researching the history of the Shot Tower Industrial Park this morning, I stumbled across a unexpected and delightful account of a historic bike tour from May 16, 1971. In “Bike Ride Through Historic Baltimore,” writer Jack Dawson, who also worked as the sports director and evening news sports anchor for WMAR-TV, describes his morning bike ride with the Coleman family, across Downtown, Fell’s Point, and South Baltimore to Fort McHenry. The group set off at set off at 8:15 am with Dawson riding a borrowed three-speed Schwinn, a bit unsteadily at first, explaining that he “hadn’t ridden a bicycle for any distance for at least 15 years.” Jill Coleman had mapped out the route for a “bike hike” organized by the Maryland Commission on Physical Fitness for the following Sunday. The full piece can be found in the ProQuest Historical Newspapers database through the Pratt Library website but I’ve pulled a few excerpts:\n\nRandall Coleman was riding his Raleigh in a circle on the parking lot without using his hands. His stepdaughters Caroline, 11, and 10-year-old Weezie (short for Louise), practiced tricks on theirs Schwinns. Mrs. Jill Coleman stood beside her station wagon, warning one of the girls to be careful.\n\n\nMerchants were opening their shops when we turned onto Broadway at 8:30. The neighborhood winos were already congregating on street corners. The driver of a foreign car stopped to let us pedal-pushers pass and flashed a wide smile and a peace sign.\n\n\nIt was obvious Mrs. Coleman had mapped out a good route for the Maryland Commission on Physical Fitness bike hike from 9 a.m. to noon next Sunday, “If we can just get a good day and a turnout, then we’ll be in clover,” she said. “I’ve made the tour four times now and each time I’ve discovered new things. The more you explore, the more you find there is to explore.”\n\nFortunately, the piece includes a map tracing the route. Many of the landmarks from the ride - the Peale Museum, Old Otterbein Church, the B & O Railroad Museum - remain much the same as in the early 1970s, while other places - notably the Inner Harbor- have been transformed beyond recognition. Now all I need to do is pick up a vintage Raleigh to give this a try myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{Bike} {Ride} {Through} {Historic} {Baltimore}” - 1971},\n  date = {2012-07-07},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-07-07-bike-ride-through-historic-baltimore-1971},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “‘Bike Ride Through Historic\nBaltimore’ - 1971.” July 7, 2012. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-07-07-bike-ride-through-historic-baltimore-1971."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been taking down illegally posted “We Buy Houses” signs (a.k.a. bandit signs) for several years now. I post about it on Twitter and Instagram using the #banditsigns hashtag and people sometimes ask me why I do it.\nIn short, the signs are illegally posted and are often associated with scam “investors” who exploit seniors (and others) with deceptive tactics and below market offers. This 2019 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article or this more recent article from Bloomberg are both helpful introductions to the issue. Elected officials in Pittsburgh recently called for state regulation of “wholesale” buyers who use these signs. Last year, the Philadelphia City Council passed a bill to protect city homeowners from similar scams. Taking down the signs makes it harder for people using these practices to reach people and take advantage of them.\nOver the past six months, I’ve taken down around 60 illegally posted “We Buy Houses” signs while riding around Baltimore City for work or errands.1 50 of these signs have been located in or near the 12th City Council District where I live.\nI thought it might be interesting to try to dig into the data on illegal signs in the district and compare the data to my own observations (while also showing off a few new features for the mapbaltimore package).\nI’ll start off by getting the boundaries for the 12th District and making a simple base map:\narea_name &lt;- \"District 12\"\narea_type &lt;- \"council district\"\n\narea &lt;- get_area(area_type, area_name)\n\narea_streets &lt;-\n  layer_area_streets(\n    area = area,\n    dist = 25,\n    color = \"gray65\",\n    sha_class = c(\"HWY\", \"INT\", \"PART\", \"MART\"),\n    linewidth = 0.75\n  )\n\narea_boundary &lt;- geom_sf(data = area, fill = NA, color = \"red\", linewidth = 1.25)\n\ncity_map &lt;-\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = buffer_area(baltimore_city, dist = 100), fill = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city, fill = \"white\", color = \"gray35\") +\n  layer_area_streets(area = baltimore_city, dist = 100, color = \"gray85\", sha_class = c(\"HWY\", \"INT\", \"PART\"), linewidth = 0.75) +\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city, fill = NA, color = \"gray35\") +\n  geom_sf(data = area, fill = NA, color = \"red\", linewidth = 0.6) +\n  theme_void()\n\ninset_city_map &lt;- patchwork::inset_element(city_map, 0.75, 0, 1, 0.25)\n\narea_map &lt;-\n  ggplot() +\n  area_streets +\n  area_boundary +\n  set_map_limits(area = area, dist = 50)\n\narea_map +\n  inset_city_map\nR mapping nerds may also appreciate this example of how to use the patchwork::inset_element() function to overlay a small key map.\nNext, I want to look at the distribution of illegally posted signs using data on 311 service requests from Open Baltimore. Anyone can use the 311 website or app to report “illegal signs on public property or public right-of-way.” The city tells users they can expect the city to “investigate and issue a citation to the responsible party if appropriate” within 15 business days.\nI also want to look at requests on “Illegal Sign Removal” which is only used “internally” (i.e. users can’t submit a request in this category) and are handled by the Department of Transportation (instead of the Department of Housing and Community Development).\nThe mapbaltimore::get_area_requests() function makes this easy. The function returns 2021 requests by default. I’m also using purrr::map_dfr() to request multiple types in succession then return a single data frame. I’m also removing duplicate addresses to avoid overplotting.\nrequests &lt;-\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    c(\n      \"HCD-Illegal Signs on Public Property\",\n      \"TRM-Illegal Sign Removal\"\n    ),\n    ~ get_area_requests(\n      area = area,\n      request_type = .x\n    ) |&gt;\n      sf::st_make_valid()\n  )\n\nrequest_locations &lt;- requests |&gt;\n  distinct(address, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\nrequest_layer &lt;- geom_sf(data = request_locations, size = 4, aes(shape = agency, color = agency), alpha = 0.4)\n\nrequest_hcd_layer &lt;- geom_sf(data = request_locations |&gt; filter(agency == \"Housing\"), size = 4, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.4)\n\narea_map +\n  request_layer +\n  labs(title = glue::glue(\"Service requests for illegal signs\\nin {area$name}, Baltimore\")) +\n  inset_city_map\nThis quick map shows how the “illegal sign removal” requests are largely used on major streets (e.g. Martin Luther King Boulevard, North Avenue and Charles Street). Reports of illegal signs on public property also look like they are clustered in certain areas. East Baltimore Midway stands out near the northeast corner of the map with a large number of reports. I suspect that this may be the result of a handful of dedicated individuals reporting every illegal sign they can find in their neighborhood.\nUnfortunately for those dedicated individuals, over the past year, illegal sign requests don’t seem to go anywhere. Among the 143 service requests for “illegal signs” submitted in 2021, 113 are “open”, 30 are “new”, and none are “closed.”\nrequests |&gt;\n  filter(agency == \"Housing\") |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = sr_status, fill = sr_status)) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Requests\",\n    x = \"Status\",\n    title = \"Status of 'Illegal Signs'\\n311 requests submitted in 2021\"\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  plot_theme\nSo, what if the city does investigates an illegal sign report and issues a citation? Unfortunately, the citation data on Open Baltimore for “Prohibited Posting of Signs on Public Property” from is basically useless for mapping.2 This means I can’t look at “prohibited posting” citations just in the 12th District but I can look at citations citywide to answer two basic questions. First, when are citations issued? Second, are citations actually paid?\n# The get_area_citations function *should* make this easy.\n# But it isn't currently working so we need to do this the hard way.\n# citations &lt;- get_area_citations(description = \"PROHIBITED POSTING\")\n\n# Import the GeoJSON with all 200K+ citations\ncitations &lt;- sf::read_sf(\"https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4324ce41e482414eb10e41a20130a6eb_0.geojson\")\n\n# Filter to \"prohibited posting citations\" and convert to an sf object\nsign_citations &lt;- citations |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names(\"snake\") |&gt;\n  filter(stringr::str_detect(description, \"^PROHIBITED POSTING\")) |&gt;\n  tidyr::separate(location, c(\"lat\", \"lon\"), sep = \",\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    across(where(is.character), ~ stringr::str_trim(.x)),\n    lat = readr::parse_number(lat),\n    lon = readr::parse_number(lon)\n  ) |&gt;\n  sf::st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  sf::st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"),\n    crs = 4326\n  )\nsign_citations |&gt;\n  filter(violation_date &gt;= lubridate::ymd(\"2011-01-01\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = lubridate::year(violation_date))) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Citations\",\n    title = \"How many 'prohibited posting'\\ncitations are issued each year?\"\n  ) +\n  plot_theme\nAfter the city issued an unusually large number of “prohibited posting” citations in 2018, they issued just 70 in 2019, 50 in 2020, and only 7 in 2021. Clearly, illegal signs have not been a priority during the pandemic—although the significant drop in citations also includes the prior year.\nsign_citations |&gt;\n  filter(violation_date &gt;= lubridate::ymd(\"2011-01-01\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    citation_status = case_when(\n      citation_status == \"A\" ~ \"Appealed\",\n      citation_status == \"O\" ~ \"Open\",\n      citation_status == \"P\" ~ \"Paid\",\n      citation_status == \"V\" ~ \"Voided\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = citation_status, fill = citation_status)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Status\",\n    y = \"Citations\",\n    title = \"Status of 'prohibited posting'\\ncitations issued since 2011\"\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  plot_theme\nWhen you look at citation status, however, you might wonder if it even matters if “prohibited posting” citations are issued or not. Less 5% of all citations in the past decade have been paid. Most of the people who post “We Buy Houses” signs use Google Voice or other VOIP services to make it more difficult to match the signs to a business or address. The signs themselves are cheap (one to two dollars each if you buy a couple hundred at a time) so the risks of getting in trouble are limited.\nI’m a big 311 enthusiast but I rarely bother submitting requests for illegally posted signs both because the city can rarely cite anyone and because it can take a long time for the city to come out and take a sign down. So, how do the locations of the signs I’m taking down compare to the locations for “illegal sign” service requests?\nAgain, the exifr::read_exif() function makes this easy. My post on making a photo key map with R back in March may be helpful for anyone wanting to learn more about this approach.\nimage_locations &lt;-\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    fs::dir_ls(path = \"images\", glob = \"*.jpeg\"),\n    ~ exifr::read_exif(.x, tags = c(\"SourceFile\", \"GPSImgDirection\", \"GPSLatitude\", \"GPSLongitude\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"GPSLongitude\", \"GPSLatitude\"), crs = 4326) |&gt;\n  sf::st_transform(2804) |&gt;\n  sf::st_crop(area)\n\narea_map +\n  request_hcd_layer +\n  geom_sf(data = image_locations, fill = \"red\", shape = 8, size = 4) +\n  labs(title = \"Illegal sign 311 requests vs.\\nwhere Eli takes down bandit signs (*)\")\nThis may not be a big surprise but this map illustrates how 311 service request data really isn’t representative of the overall scale or distribution of this issue. I take down signs in Oliver and Barclay more often than almost anywhere else and there are almost no illegal sign service requests from either neighborhood. The same goes for McElderry Park located right outside the 12th district on near the southeast corner of the map.\nIn the end, though, you don’t need perfect data to address this issue. You just need 20 seconds to take down a bandit sign next time you see one. And the next time and the next time—until the scammers stop putting them up.\nbanditsign_images &lt;-\n  purrr::map(\n    image_locations$SourceFile[1:25],\n    ~ magick::image_read(.x) |&gt;\n      magick::image_ggplot()\n  )\n\npatchwork::wrap_plots(banditsign_images) +\n  patchwork::plot_annotation(title = '25 \"We Buy Houses\" signs I took down in 2021')"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In many ways, I’m useless as an architectural historian. I’ll point to a building and say “look at that thing above the other thing made out of stone!” Usually enthusiastic pointing can carry the day, despite my failure to recall the specific term (often French) that can be applied to the unique variation of a distinctive style that I never bothered to learn the name for. Even those who paid a bit more attention when studying up on the details of building technologies and historic styles however, often find themselves reaching for a visual architectural dictionary or a field guide when working on a building description.\nPersonally, when I’m in a tough spot trying to identify a variation on a style or put a names to an odd little detail, I turn instead to Wikipedia. As with many topics, Wikipedia consistently offers a wide range of useful references on the broad domains of architectural history and historic building technologies. For example, take a quick look at this solid article on arches including a tremendous set of illustrations of arch forms organized roughly the order in which they were developed.” Two more practical favorites are the pages on brickwork and hinges familiar topics to many folks who work with historic buildings.\nCategorization can be a bit uneven but where someone has taken an interest you can browse articles by stylistic associations, time period, or use, much more useful than the alphabetical order enforced by the constraints of print publications. Overarching categories include architectural elements, architectural styles, building materials, and more. Within each category narrower sub-categories proliferate from Baroque architectural features, Greek Revival architecture, or simply Roofs.\nThere is still a great deal of writing, photography and illustration needed to improve the breadth and depth of articles related to architecture and architectural history. Like many more traditional architectural dictionaries, Wikipedia is currently more useful for monumental high-style buildings and architects than it is for local historians and preservationists often working with vernacular buildings. This challenge brings me to a final point where Wikipedia can improve on a traditional architectural dictionary: working together we can make it better. Preservationists and architectural historians can join in ongoing efforts like the Architecture or National Register of Historic Places WikiProjects or start a new effort more closely focused on historic preservation, local history, or vernacular architecture and landscapes.\nI’m not quite ready to throw out my field guide entirely but I hope that I’m not alone in finding Wikipedia as a welcome alternative.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2011,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Throw Away Your Architectural Dictionary or {Why}\n    Preservationists Should Be Using (and Contributing) to {Wikipedia}},\n  date = {2011-04-14},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-04-14-throw-away-your-architectural-dictionary-or-why-preservationists-should-be-using-and-contributing-to-wikipedia},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2011. “Throw Away Your Architectural Dictionary or\nWhy Preservationists Should Be Using (and Contributing) to\nWikipedia.” April 14, 2011. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-04-14-throw-away-your-architectural-dictionary-or-why-preservationists-should-be-using-and-contributing-to-wikipedia."

    "text": "H.L. Mencken learned to ride a bicycle in the lot behind a bicycle shop owned by Joseph Wiesenfeld at the southwest corner of West Baltimore and Paca Streets. He recalled the story in a piece from Mencken on Mencken, a collection of autobiographical writing originally published in the New Yorker and Esquire during the 1940s:\nWiesenfeld, known as “little joe” thanks to short stature, was a successful Jewish business owner who opened the bicycle shop in 1892. A Baltimore native born in 1864, Wiesenfeld gained local fame at age 15 racing a high-wheel bicycle around Druid Hill Lake and remained an active member and supporter of Baltimore cycling clubs for years. His business soon expanded into a sporting goods store (specializing in saddles and tack) that still stands at the northwest corner of Baltimore and Howard Streets.\nIn 1957, Clarence R. Mahrer, a former bicycle salesman at Howard French’s competing shop at 304 West Baltimore, recalled the tremendous popularity of bicycles in the 1900s when Baltimore boasted 80 to 90 bike stores and dozens of bike clubs - the Myrtle Wheelmen, Lafayette Wheelmen, Yale Wheelmen, Peacock Wheelmen and others.\nDuring the 1960s, the University of Maryland urban renewal project led by the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Commission tore down the old bicycle shop, along with over eight acres of buildings on the west side of downtown Baltimore, to make way for parks, parking lots and new construction for the university and hospital. The block where H.L. Mencken learned to ride a bike is now occupied by University Square Park.\nThanks to Patrick McMahon for turning up the inspiring quote from Mencken on Mencken. I’m hoping there may be a H.L. Mencken bike tour in my future."

    "title": "Baltimore Data Day: How are people using data on Open Baltimore?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I had the opportunity to participate in Baltimore Data Day again this year as part of a panel discussion on Open Baltimore, the city’s seven-year-old open data portal. The narrative notes from my presentation are below and should (mostly) match up with my Google Slides.\nThe presentation is based in part on my rough analysis of the Open Baltimore public asset inventory including a look at just the community or custom views of data created by registered Open Baltimore users and the official datasets (excluding derived views like maps or visualization). I used a Twitter search for mentions of @OpenBaltimore to collect examples of past reactions and complaints. And, I also shared my initial findings on Twitter while soliciting feedback from local residents who have used Open Baltimore. I combined this recent history with a closer look at the history of GIS that I compiled into a rough timeline (also available in an open Google Sheet).\n\nI’m here today because I’m a data nerd and Baltimore City resident who is equally enthusiastic about using, praising, and criticizing Open Baltimore. Like many others, I’m frustrated by all the ways in which Open Baltimore doesn’t work. And I’ll be talking about those frustrations today. But I also want to start by urging everyone to see fixing these problems as a shared responsibility. By listening to one another’s experiences, I think we can make Open Baltimore better and make Baltimore better at the same time.\nSo let’s start with a look at the recent history of people using Open Baltimore.\nThe first data set uploaded to Open Baltimore—a GIS shapefile of building footprints—was added on January 21, 2011. Northeast Baltimore resident Rob Walshe created the first custom view on Open Baltimore just five days later when he created a list of 311 service requests for graffiti removal in the neighborhoods of Hamilton and Gardenville.\nOver seven years have passed and eight hundred people have created accounts on Open Baltimore to create their own custom views of the city’s open data. This group of users include residents in Medfield, Oliver, Violetville, Homeland, and Howard Park. Some use Open Baltimore to learn about their neighborhoods. Others use the data in their work as journalists, educators, organizers, and researchers. While most people only ever create a single custom view, some create multiple views—often on behalf of a community group.\nYou can judge the popularity of Open Baltimore data sets by page views or downloads but I am more interested in the people who are trying to do something with the data beyond just looking at it. So today, we are looking at these users and the data they’re using including:\n\nvictim-based crimes\n311 customer service requests\nvacant building notices\narrests\nand 911 calls\n\nTogether, people have created nearly fourteen hundred custom views based on just these five data sets—totalling over seventy percent of the custom views created on Open Baltimore since 2011.\nBut, despite their consistent interest in using the data published on Open Baltimore, resident experiences with the service are a mix of education, empowerment, and aggravation.\nOne Howard Park resident, John Schladen, started using Open Baltimore in November 2012 and started working with his neighbors to document vacant buildings in their neighborhood. In a March 2015 interview with the Baltimore Sun, John noted the importance of data on housing for residents in Howard Park:\n\n“If we can begin to understand our own condition as a community, we’re going to have much more power.”\n\nBetween January 2014 and November 2015, Samantha Armacost created twenty-five custom views on Open Baltimore on behalf of the Medfield Community Assoication. But, in 2015, she grew frustrated after changes in the availability of victim-based crime data undermined her efforts make sense of public safety in her community. She no longer uses the site.\nUnpredictable coverage wasn’t the only concern for residents or researchers. In an August 2014 report Eric Burnstein and Seema Iyer, noted the difficulty of using the “rounded address” (the unit block number and street name) to assign incidents to neighborhoods. As a result, the 2014 publication of BNIA-JFI’s annual “Vital Signs” report “excluded many crime indicators for the first time since its inception.”\nJournalist Danielle Sweeney started using Open Baltimore in August 2015 as part of her reporting for the Baltimore Brew on police responses to property crime. By April 2017, when she turned to Twitter in frustration, writing: “No one ever answers my questions.” Fortunately, Danielle was not disuaded and actually expanded her use of the site in 2017 and 2018.\nWhile Open Baltimore may not be responsible for the errors and inconsistency in the data provided by city agencies, poor communication does little to correct any misconceptions. User comments on 911 call data point out missing and incorrect information without any offiial reponse.\nThe footer of Open Baltimore encourages people to “nominate a dataset” but the published comments highlight the confusion experienced by many individuals using the site. People are looking for data sets that are already available and wondering what happened to data that has disappeared from public view. People report issues with incorrect or missing data. Few comments of any kind have been published lately. No “dataset suggestions” have been marked as “approved” since February 18, 2014. Users submitted 148 suggestions over the first five years of Open Baltimore’s operation. Over the last two and a half years, only twenty-one suggestions have been submitted. Given the lack of response to prior submissions, people could be forgiven for deciding that trying to request new data on Open Baltimore may not be worth the trouble.\nOf course, Open Baltimore isn’t the only source for data and public information from city agencies. And these other sources have their own challenges: confusing interfaces, inaccessible web design, and dated technical infrastructure. You don’t need take my word for it. Please try finding data and information on a few of these sites:\n\nBaltimore City Health Department Food Facility Inspection Reports database\nThe Department of Planning’s Community Association Directory\nThe database of applications, inspection reports, and other documents from the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City\nBaltimore Housing’s codeMap\n\nCan you find the information you need using these sites? Do you feel like the information is accurate and up to date? If not, why not? \nAll to often, residents searching for essential public information run into frustrating and disappointing road blocks. Open Budget Baltimore created by the Bureau of the Budget and Management Research is just one revealing example of this problem. The site tells visitors that the “data that powers Open Budget” is “available to you.” But my recent attempt to follow the link data led back to Open Baltimore where I was confronted by a message tell me to go “Back to where you came from.” Is this what it feels like to have your own city gas-lighting you?\nI truly don’t want to spend our time together on a re-visiting past complaints. Instead, I’d like to find a way to bridge the gap between the aspirations and dreams we’ve brought to Open Baltimore and the experiences it offers for people in Baltimore today.\nFor people who believe in the power of data to make the city a better place, you should remember that you are part of a long tradition.\nIn February 1907, Theodore Marburg, founder and president of the Municipal Art Society, gathered “City and State officials, heads of city departments, City Councilmen and leaders of the thought of a great university” for a “round table” and “smoker” in the Hotel Rennert (where the Charles Center parking lot stands today) to listen to “expositions of the advantages and benefits to be derived” from the city’s new Legislative Reference Department headed by Dr. Horace E. Flack. Before a group of twenty-five White men who sat around a table sipping cups of punch and smoking “fragrant cigars” in the hotel’s “cafe clubroom,” Marburg proclaimed:\n\n“In this hour of change, the most thorough investigation into a city problem made today may be out of date tomorrow. The price of intelligent action is constant investigation. …The money value of adequate data on things we are about to do is difficult to measure.”\n\n\n\n\nHotel Rennert, c. 1896. Published by Alfred S. Campbell. Courtesy Library of Congress.\n\n\nThe costs of ignorance may be difficult to measure but we’ve lived with them for as long as Baltimore has been around. For people who are frustrated with the state of open data in Baltimore today, you are also part of a long tradition.\nIt shouldn’t be a surprise to learn that the Citizen’s Planning and Housing Association (CPHA), for example, has created one hundred and fifty custom views on Open Baltimore—more than any other single user. CPHA has a long history of advocating for city staff and elected officials to improve the ways they organize and share data about housing, transportation, and countless other issues. In one 1965 editorial that sounds all too familiar, the organization observed:\n\n“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”\n\nCPHA’s advocacy led to the creation of the Department of Housing and Community Development in 1968 and, by the mid-1970s, the creation of the city’s first “Vacant House File”—a collection of punch cards created for use with a mainframe computer. Today, using codeMap, anyone can find answers to at least some of these questions.\nWhat can we take away from this recent history and the much longer history that preceded it? Here are a few ideas for what the staff reponsible for Open Baltimore and everyone who plays a part in opening access to public data online could consider:\n\nThe limits or quirks of Socrata may be one source of the problems with Open Baltimore. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that it is the only part or even the most important part.\nConsistent location data is key to ensuring inter-operability and ease of reuse by residents and researchers alike.\nOpen Baltimore and all of the city’s online services need to put a higher priority on accessibility and education.\nOpen Baltimore needs meaningful and useful opportunities for feedback that can be used by both city staff and residents.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2018,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Baltimore {Data} {Day:} {How} Are People Using Data on {Open}\n    {Baltimore?}},\n  date = {2018-07-13},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2018-07-13-open-baltimore},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2018. “Baltimore Data Day: How Are People Using Data\non Open Baltimore?” July 13, 2018. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2018-07-13-open-baltimore."

    "title": "Baltimore Data Day: Vacant housing, trash, and making data open in Harwood",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is a slightly revised version of my lunchtime lightning talk at Baltimore Data Day 2017. This script corresponds to my slides. Thanks to Ciara Christian for the opportunity to share my work around vacant housing, trash, and 311 data.\n\nIntroduction\nHello! My name is Eli Pousson and I work for Baltimore Heritage, a small nonprofit that advocates for historic preservation across the city. I’ll admit I’m a not a statistician or a GIS expert. I’m a professional historian and an amateur data nerd. I also won’t pretend to have any “objectivity” about vacant houses and trash in Harwood. I live in Harwood and I care about what happens in my neighborhood.\n\n\nHarwood\nHarwood isn’t the kind of neighborhood most people think about when you say the words “historic preservation.” It isn’t a historic district and our homes are mostly modest two-story rowhouses. But I like to think about preservation as the work of keeping old buildings in use and making old neighborhoods better places for the people who live there.\n\n\nHarwood Park\nBecause old buildings aren’t the only places that need a little tender loving care. So, for nearly a year, I’ve been hanging out at Harwood Park on the 400 block of E. 27th Street cleaning up a few times a month. If a clean park helps to create a more stable housing market, even in a small way, that helps old buildings in my neighborhood.\n\n\nVacants on E. 27th Street\nAnd old buildings in my neighborhood need help. These vacant houses stand right across the street from the park. Overall, the Greater Charles Village/Barlcay Community Statistical Area has a 5.4% vacancy rate—less than the city average. But, as most Baltimoreans know, you can’t ignore the challenge of unoccupied and neglected buildings that haven’t yet met the city’s requirements to issue an official vacant building notice.\n\n\nVacant Buildings 101\nThis past winter, Baltimore Heritage partnered with the Community Law Center to develop a workshop we called Vacant Buildings 101 to teach community residents how to deal with vacant buildings. And the workshop gave me an opportunity to wonder: How can data help people deal with vacant buildings?\nData can help me to look at a vacant house and see more than just an “eyesore.” I can look and see if code enforcement is working for my neighborhood. I can use 311 data to build a case for a vacant building notice. I can learn when fighting for building rehabilitation and reuse makes sense and when stabilization or demolition may be the only option.\n\n\n411 E. 27th Street\n\n\n\n400 block of E. 27th Street\n\n\nOf course, most folks don’t deal with vacant houses as data in a spreadsheet. They deal with vacants one at a time.\n411 E. 27th Street is a single data point: a vacant building notice issued on February 19, 2015. One of thirty-five vacant building notices in Harwood. One of five on this block.\n\n\nTrash by the entrance to Harwood Park\nVacant houses are not the only problem on this block. I may not have the money to fix up every old house in Harwood but I can do something about this mess on our our playground. And I can tell you that picking up garbage and using 311 to report illegal dumping is a great way to learn about using and making open data in your neighborhood.\n\n\n1965 report from the Citizens Planning & Housing Association\nThe challenge of gathering data and interpreting data on vacants has a long history. In a 1965 report, the Citizens Planning & Housing Association wrote:\n\n“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”\n\n\n\nWhere does data come from?\nWhile we have a lot more of this data today, I can say with confidence that many of my neighbors don’t know where to find or how to interpret data on vacants in our neighborhood.\nIn addition, vacant building notices are tied to code enforcement actions. These actions are often triggered by 311 reports and we can expect people from different background to use 311 in different ways. This variation reveals the inherently uneven approach we use to identify and document issues in our neighborhoods.\n\n\ncodeMap showing parcels with vacant building notices\nSo let’s take a look at the data available to me and other residents interested in vacants and trash. codeMap is a remarkable resource for giving residents, community advocates, and developers the opportunity to access much of the same data used by city planners and Housing Department to direct code enforcment officers, prioritize recievership cases, and budget funding for demolition and stabilization.\n\n\nRS Link database on receivership cases\ncodeMap also links out to a variety of data sources such as the RSLink database used by Baltimore Housing and One House at a Time to track receivership cases from the first filing to the final sale. I don’t think I’d call this “open” data, however. While you can see these records one at a time, everyday users are not able to search the database or create reports.\n\n\nCARTO map of receivership auction results\nThe city doesn’t provide bulk access to this data so I decided reached out to One House at a Time directly. They shared their data on recievership auctions for 2015 and 2016 making it possible for us to create this map showing successful and unsucessful auctions across the city. Five houses in Harwood went through receivership in 2015 and 2016 and all five sold.\n\n\n“Truck tire” next to 411 E. 27th Street\nBack to E. 27th Street. One of the key lessons here is that just because you have access to information doesn’t mean you see it. Sometimes 311 requests get ignored when an inspector can’t find the problem. With a bright pink arrow pointing to the truck tire, I figured they couldn’t miss it. (I’ve used this same approach with several requests, e.g. a mattress on E. 27th Street. The graphic is made with an app called Skitch.)\n\n\n311 data for Harwood on Open Baltimore\nMy 311 service requests are important to me but I know they are just a handful of the never-ending stream of service requests that city agencies recieve throughout the year. For example, in 2016, Harwood alone saw 1,720 requests to the Bureau of Solid Waste.\n\n\nCharting 311 data in Google Sheets\nI pulled the 311 data for Harwood from the Open Baltimore data portal into Google Sheets where I could more easily do some basic analysis and share the results with my neighbors. One of the things I learned from this data is that my love for the 311 iPhone app makes me a bit of an outlier. Only a relatively small portion of 311 requests are submitted through the mobile apps. Most of the 311 requests in my neighborhood are submitted by phone.\n\n\nWhat happens after you call 311?\nI also really wanted to know what happened to my 311 requests and how they compared to those of my neighbors. This complicated flow diagram (made using RAWGraphs and Vectr) was my first attempt at following requests from submission to outcome – I’d love to see what other people can make of this data.\n\n\nHeatmap of Bureau of Solid Waste service requests in Harwood\nI knew we were having problems with dumping at Harwood Park but what about other parts of my neighborhood? I pulled my data from Google Sheets into CARTO, a free web-based GIS mapping tool, to make a heat map for hotspots of illegal dumping. I also solicited feedback from my neighbors on NextDoor. I used the map and feedback from my neighbors to put together a short tour for Terrance Brown from the city’s Department of Public Works.\n\n\nHauling concrete debris by hand after repeated 311 requests\nMy tour with DPW came after I had I’d submitted two 311 service requests for a pile of illegally dumped concrete debris on our playground. Both 311 requests were closed after DPW (or their contractors) removed some trash from the area but left the concrete. I emailed DPW for more information and scheduled the tour to discuss the issue. If we just looked at the data, it looks like we were getting good service in Harwood—but we weren’t yet. I decided to try to deal with the problem myself by piling the concerete into my old half-broken-down wheelbarrow and (with a little help from Donald at the Charles Village Community Benefits District) getting into a dumpster for the Mayor’s Spring Clean Up Day. Four large pieces remained up until late May!\n\n\nConnecting housing and litter at Whitridge and Greenmount Avenue\nNow I’m working around the corner on the lot at Whitridge and Greenmount Avenue. Strong City Baltimore has identified the poor condition as a barrier to the sale of the rehabbed houses on Whitridge Row. It is also unfortunate for people waiting for the bus on Greenount Avenue. While we can use data to argue for the importance of lot improvements, we can also put on some gloves and make a “data visualization” like this one: showing the amount of garbage one person can pick up on this lot in about fifteen minutes.\n\n\nMaking data open\nI’ll wrap up by inviting everyone to try to explore how you can make data more open.\n\nTry setting up an account on Open Baltimore and creating a filtered view for your neighborhood. (See my tutorial on using Open Baltimore for tips.)\nNext time you make a report: skip the PDF and just share a Google Spreadsheet. (I’ve set up Google Sheets with data on demolition permits and citations for property owners who failed to abate unsafe properties.)\nDon’t just record data, take photos and show your work along the way. (I stay motivated to address litter and dumping issues by sharing photos of litter on Instagram at #riseandpickuplitter)\nDon’t just use data. Be part of making data!\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2017,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Baltimore {Data} {Day:} {Vacant} Housing, Trash, and Making\n    Data Open in {Harwood}},\n  date = {2017-07-14},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-07-14-baltimore-data-day},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2017. “Baltimore Data Day: Vacant Housing, Trash,\nand Making Data Open in Harwood.” July 14, 2017. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-07-14-baltimore-data-day."

    "title": "Researching Confederate monuments and Civil War memory at the Maryland Historical Society",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A few weeks ago, I decided to apply for the Lord Baltimore Fellowship at the Maryland Historical Society to continue the research I started in 2015 on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments and Civil War memory in Baltimore. This week, I heard the good news that the Maryland Historical Society accepted my application. This year-long fellowship is unpaid but comes with the exciting opportunity of “staff-level” access to the Society’s library and archives.\nI began researching Confederate memory in June 2015 just a few days after the shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. I created a simple timeline on the history of Confederate monuments in Baltimore and published a blog post detailing the earliest local effort to erect a Confederate monument in 1880. That fall, I put together a detailed report for Baltimore Heritage and presented testimony before the Special Commission to Review Baltimore’s Public Confederate Monuments.\nOf course, my own interest on this topic has a history of its’ own. A July 2011 archaeological dig to explore the Civil War camp and hospital at West Baltimore’s Lafayette Square and a Civil War bike tour in November led to a presentation at the Society for Historical Archaeology in January 2012 on the meaning of public archaeology and Civil War history in historically black neighborhoods. In November 2013, I put together a tour of Mount Vernon Place on the histories of slavery and emancipation. You can find my rough notes for that tour in the Baltimore Heritage open tour collection.\nWhy am I sharing all this back story? I think it is important for everyone, myself included, to think about how our knowledge of the past is built up over time. Our understanding of the past as individuals and communities is directly shaped by the politics of the places where we live and learn.\nAfter the publication of the Special Commission’s final report in September 2016 and the installation of new interpretive plaques at each of the Confederate monuments considered in the city’s review, there has been little public discussion around Baltimore’s Confederate monuments. Without funding or more active leadership by Baltimore’s Mayor or City Council, all four monuments seem likely to stay in place for the near future.\nIn New Orleans, however, the removal of four monuments associated with white supremacy and the Confederacy began in April and ended on May 19, 2017. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu marked removal of the last of the four monuments with a widely-circulated speech explaining the city’s decision to take them down:\n\nSo relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, this is not about blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once.\nThis is, however, about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile and most importantly, choose a better future for ourselves making straight what has been crooked and making right what was wrong. Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price with discord, with division and yes with violence.\n\nI feel confident that Baltimore is not done talking about Confederate monuments and Civil War memory. Given the Maryland Historical Society’s own history in shaping local Civil War memory and importance role as a place where collections related to both the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement have found a home, the institution seems like the perfect place to take a closer look at these topics. If you’re interested, you can read my research proposal below. I’d love to hear your questions or suggestions for my research in the year ahead.\n\nBaltimore has a notable number of Confederate monuments for a city that remained with the Union throughout the Civil War. There are three Confederate monuments located in the city’s public parks and medians: the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1903) on Mount Royal Avenue, the Confederate Women’s Monument (1917) on University Parkway, and the Lee-Jackson Monument (1948) located at Wyman Park Dell. A fourth statue on Mount Vernon Place—the Roger Brooke Taney Monument (1887)—memorializes a Maryland lawyer and Supreme Court Justice whose decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case earned him lasting infamy as an opponent of black freedom.\n\n\n\nConfederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, Mount Royal Avenue, c. 1903. Courtesy Library of Congress, det.4a10969.\n\n\nMany other monuments and statues have connections to Civil War memory—some obvious but others obscure. Thes include memorial statues to the Confederate dead in Loudon Park Cemetery; the enormous 1909 Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument relocated from Druid Hill Park to Wyman Park Dell in 1959; a 1911 monument to Confederate veteran John Mifflin Hood located at Preston Gardens since 1963; a 1919 statue of Confederate veteran and Baltimore Mayor Thomas G. Hayes at City Hall.\nReminders of Civil War memory are seen in the red and white symbol of the “Crossland Banner” in the Maryland State Flag (officially adopted in 1904) and heard in the state song, “Maryland, My Maryland” adopted in 1939. The Maryland Historical Society itself put on numerous exhibitions of Civil War art and artifacts over the institution’s history. In October 1947, the Maryland Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy worked with the Maryland Historical Society to open an exhibition of Confederate relics for students in Baltimore City public schools. In 1968, the addition of the Thomas and Hugg Building included a “Union Room” established to supplement the long-standing “Confederate Room”.\nAlthough scholarly research on the Civil War in Maryland is extensive, histories of Civil War memory in Maryland are harder to find. Charles W. Mitchell covers the topic in the epilogue to his extensive compendium Maryland Voices of the Civil War. Other historians, notably  David Blight in his influential 2002 study Race and Reunion or Paul Shackel in his 2003 book Memory in Black and White, have looked at the significant role of Civil War battlefields and related memorials as sites of conflict and reconciliation.\nMy own 2015 research on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments has inspired my current interest in looking at the broader picture of Civil War memory in Baltimore and exploring how the monuments fit within a landscape of visual and literary culture created by Confederate and Union veterans, their descendants, and scholars who studied the Civil War from the nineteenth century up to the present. Within this landscape, the central importance of education, such as textbooks and approaches to teaching Civil War history, stands out as a subject that demands deeper consideration.\nIn addition, I’m interested in unpacking the largely obscure political dimensions of Civil War memory in Baltimore. For example, in 1887, Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe refused to appear at the dedication of the Taney Monument at Mount Vernon Place to protest the prominent speaking role granted to his political antagonist Severn Teackle Wallis. In 1948, the Afro-American Newspaper responded to Governor William Preston Lane Jr.’s remarks at the dedication of the Lee-Jackson Monument at Wyman Park Dell by challenging his support from the Southern Governors’ Association and their opposition to desegregation of public universities. In both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Confederate monuments cannot be separated from the politics of the people who supported their erection. I believe the enduring legacy of local expressions of Civil War memory cannot truly be understood or evaluated without putting the topic in conversation with the history of the politics surrounding race and Civil Rights movement.\nGiven the breadth of the Maryland Historical Society’s collections there are several potential directions for how I could use the available resources to further this research. Relevant materials include the papers of Confederate veterans like Adalbert J. Volck (MS 867); early historians of the Confederacy such as J. Thomas Scharf (MS 1999); institutions that served Confederate veterans directly such as the Confederate Maryland Line Beneficial Association (MS 255) and the Maryland Line Confederate Soldiers’ Home (PP159; MS 256); individuals who directly participated in the creation and dedication of Confederate monuments such as Colonel Benjamin Franklin Taylor (MS 1863). Additional context on the process of commissioning of public artwork during the early twentieth century might be found in the records of the Municipal Arts Society (MS 2875). One of the most significant collections available for this research is the records of the United Daughters of the Confederacy covering the period from 1936 to 1984 (MS 2846). The availability of records from the 1960s and 1970s suggests the possibility of learning more about the group’s reaction to such efforts as the creation of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) in 1969 or the Negro Soldier Monument originally located next to the Battle Monument in 1972.\nThe overall goal of this effort, however, is not just to satisfy my curiosity with a detailed scholarly study or unearth forgotten records from the archives. Instead, I hope to explore new ways to make Civil War memory relevant and meaningful to Baltimore residents in the present. I’m especially interested in how to make the topic relevant to young people; a goal that, perhaps ironically, many “Lost Cause” historians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century shared.\nConnecting African American audiences with Civil War history has been a challenge for many contemporary public historians. Writer and Baltimore native Ta-Nehisi Coates reflected in a 2011 NPR interview on how African Americans have been excluded from the interpretation of the Civil War through “Lost Cause” mythologies. Coates remarked that, “one of the most depressing things [he] found,” was when a tour guide at the Gettysburg Battlefield park told him, “‘You can sit there for hours — and you can count on one hand the number of African-Americans that come into the battle park.’” In a 2012 article for The Atlantic magazine, Coates describes how the “country’s battlefields are marked with the enduring evidence” of the “tireless efforts” by Confederate descendants to present their own story of the Civil War—a story that, despite their defeat in the conflict, erased their ancestors complicity with the system of slavery that Confederate troops had fought for and died trying to preserve.\nIn 2015, the Charleston church shooting pushed the topic of Confederate memory to the front of public debates in a new way. The often contentious debates that followed have made it difficult to ignore the continued political significance of Civil War memory as an issue. With this study, I hope to find ways of using the history of Civil War memory to support constructive conversations on the relationship between memorials and politics in the past and in the future.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2017,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Researching {Confederate} Monuments and {Civil} {War} Memory\n    at the {Maryland} {Historical} {Society}},\n  date = {2017-05-24},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-05-24-lord-baltimore-fellowship},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2017. “Researching Confederate Monuments and Civil\nWar Memory at the Maryland Historical Society.” May 24, 2017. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-05-24-lord-baltimore-fellowship."

When I got back to my desk, I thought the advice might be worth writing up into a quick tutorial.\nIn my experience, it takes about five hours to plan a two-hour-long walking tour program. It may take you more or less time depending on your background and how you approach the tour. The process I use works best for guided walking tours where you already have information about most or all of the tour sites. If you are planning a guided bike tours or bus tours or any self-guided tour, you may need to tweak this approach. If you are just getting started and do not know what tour sites might be appropriate to visit, you may need to do more research before you plan your walking tour."

I added titles to each image in the Photos app then exported them to the jpg subfolder I created in the image folder for this post. The following code shows how to use purrr::map_dfr to import selected metadata for each image, sort the images by longitude, and then number the images in order."

This function returns a bounding box that contains all of the photo locations with a little extra space (fifty meters) around the edges and a set aspect ratio (4 by 3).\nThe next step is to make the map base layer using the layer_mapbox function from the maplayer package. For this to work, you need to a Mapbox API key to pass to the function or to save it to your local environment using mapboxapi::mb_access_token().1\nNow I can mark the location of each photograph with the corresponding number on top of the base map.

Library of Congress, vrg 00340.\n\n\n\nI’ve been driving up and down Harford Road pretty regularly over the past few weeks for our work on the Herring Run Archaeology project. Each time I return back down to Mount Vernon, this midcentury bank building at 2056 Harford Road just called out to me. Knowing nothing about the building, I went looking for some more details.\nA quick search turned up a Baltimore Sun account from September 4, 1956 - Branch Bank To Be Marked By New Look - turned up some key details on this former branch location for the Union Trust Bank:\n\n“A long-range program of modernization has resulted in the construction of eight new, modern bank buildings to replace old structures, plus extensive remodeling and enlargement of five additional branch offices in a ten-year period. There are now 25 Union Trust banking offices scattered through the Baltimore area. […] Designed by Smith & Veale, local architects, the new building is to give the conception of a glass box. The steel frame is exposed and treated as part of the architecture of the building. Masonry masses are utilized to conceal the vault and other security facilities of the branch. […] Ample hard-surfaced parking area on the rear of the lot is afforded for walk-in customers. A drive-up window beneath a canopy is available along the side of the building.”\n\nThe firm of Smith & Veale was a partnership of local architects Thomas W. Smith and Graham Veale established shortly after the end of World War II. The firm designed scores of modern banks, libraries and schools. Veale, who passed away in 1996 at the age of 91, was a Philadelphia native who came to Baltimore as a teenager. Smith died in 1998 at the age of 89. I recently profiled two other buildings designed by the firm - the KAGRO Building on North Avenue and the North Point Branch of the Baltimore County Public Library - as part of a nascent effort to expand our coverage of modernism in Explore Baltimore Heritage. I’d love to located the eight new Union Trust bank branches mentioned above and add them to our growing collection. If you’re interested in modernist architecture in Baltimore, please join the Baltimore Modernism Project Facebook group to share ideas, research and writing on this theme.\nThe striking combination of the midcentury sign board and the cantilevered canopy above the bank’s drive-through window was regrettably demolished in the fall of 2013 - not long after the deteriorated condition of the building was highlighted with a public artwork by Wall Hunters Mural project. The bank building remains vacant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph by Nether via Baltimore Slumlord Watch.\n\n\nWhen Google Streetview last captured Harford Road in October 2014, a “For Rent” advertised the building’s availability and included a phone number t0 call for more information: 443-255-2028.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{Branch} {Bank} {To} {Be} {Marked} {By} {New} {Look}”},\n  date = {2015-05-18},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-05-18-branch-bank-to-be-marked-by-new-look},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “‘Branch Bank To Be Marked By New\nLook’.” May 18, 2015. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-05-18-branch-bank-to-be-marked-by-new-look."

    "text": "I recently picked up Scraping By: Wage Labor, Slavery, and Survival in Early Baltimore by Seth Rockman - a study of poor and working-class laborers in early 19th century Baltimore. I have not read much labor history and sincerely appreciated Rockman’s revealing observation about the growth of Baltimore and similar cities during the early Republic period:\n\n“At a moment of great entrepreneurial energy and social mobility, prosperity came to Americans who could best assemble, deploy, and exploit the physical labor of others. The early republic’s economy opened up new possibilities for some Americans precisely because it closed down opportunities for others.”\n\nWhat really hooked me on the book was this masterful paragraph painting a vivid portrait of Baltimore in relationship to the broader Atlantic world:\n\n“Imagine a scene on the docks of Baltimore in 1816, as American-born stevedores loaded crates of ready-made shirts aboard a merchant ship bound for South America. Focusing in on the ship, one might see a rural miller haggling with the captain over the price of one of the indentured teenagers whom the ship had recently brought from Bremen, or a free black mariner signing articles to work the outgoing voyage as an ordinary seaman. Expand the view, and one might glimpse that sailor’s laundress wife washing clothes in Harford Run, or the sailor’s enslaved sister serving tea in the home of the merchant who owned the ship and hoping that her brother might one day accumulate enough money to purchase her freedom. A widening perspective reveals the widowed seamstresses stitching shirts at home, as well as the apprenticed boys winding thread in Baltimore’s first manufactories on the outskirts of town. Along the waterfront, a middle-aged white domestic servant might be cooking breakfast in a Fells Point boardinghouse, where some of the ship’s crew spent its shore leave in the company of women supporting themselves through prostitution. In the harbor, Scotch-Irish dredgers on the mudmachine were battling sedimentation to keep Baltimore’s port open. From an even broader vantage, one might see the enslaved field laborers of a distant cotton plantation, whose growing market value encouraged urban slaveholders to resist liberating the men, women, and children they owned in Baltimore or even the menial workers in Lancashire, Cap Francois, Ouidah, and Paramaribo– the”Atlantic proletariat” whose labor integrated an already global economy.”\n\nAwesome.

    "text": "The Enoch Pratt Free Library—Baltimore’s public library system—recently reopened for in-person browsing for the first time in nearly a year. This past Sunday, I visited the Enoch Pratt’s Clifton branch for the first time and I really enjoyed the novelty of exploring a new library after so many months away from any library at all. My ten-year-old daughter shared my excitement so we started talking about the idea of visiting every public library in the city this spring and summer.\n\n\n\nChild giving two thumbs-up standing in front of a brick branch library building.\n\n\nWhen we made it back home, I decided to make a simple map we could use to keep track of the libraries as we go. We usually ride our bikes when we visit the library so I also wanted to show the distance between each library and our neighborhood. The map is simple but I’m happy with how it turned out so I wanted to write up the approach. It shows off a few ways to handle label placement but I’m really hoping it might entice a few neighbors into visiting a few more libraries this spring as well.\nTo start, I loaded ggplot2 and dplyr packages, and my own mapbaltimore package. I’m also using a couple functions from sf, purrr, and stringr.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(mapbaltimore)\n\nNext, I pulled in the boundary of the Harwood neighborhood where I live, found the center of the neighborhood using the st_centroid function, and applied a buffer ranging from one to six miles. Including the approximate mileage is especially helpful since I’m hoping we can bike to most (if not all) of these libraries before the summer heat sets in.\n\n# Get center of area\narea &lt;- get_area(\"neighborhood\", \"Harwood\")\ncenter &lt;- sf::st_centroid(area)\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# Define buffers ranging from 1 to 6 miles\nmiles &lt;- seq(6)\n# Convert miles to meters\nmeters &lt;- miles * 1609.344\n\narea_dist &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(\n  meters,\n  ~ buffer_area(center, dist = .x)\n)\n\nWarning: `buffer_area()` was deprecated in mapbaltimore 0.1.2.\nℹ Please use `sfext::st_buffer_ext()` instead.\n\n\nUnfortunately, if I try to label the buffered areas it doesn’t work very well. All of the labels overlap at the center of the area.\n\ntheme_set(theme_void() + theme(plot.margin = margin(0)))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = area) +\n  geom_sf(data = area_dist, fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf_text(data = bind_cols(area_dist, dist = miles), aes(label = dist))\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid this issue, I can use the clip_area function from mapbaltimore to return a five meter edge along the left side of each of the buffered areas.\n\n# Clip buffered areas\narea_label &lt;- purrr::map_dfr(\n  meters,\n  ~ buffer_area(center, dist = .x) %&gt;%\n    clip_area(clip = \"right\", edge_dist = 5) %&gt;%\n    bind_cols(label = paste0(.x / 1609.344, \" mi\"))\n)\n\nWe can take a quick look at how these elements come together. I set the already set theme to theme_void() but I updated the defaults for geom_text, created a background layer (layer_city) that combines the detailed physical boundary of the city (baltimore_city_detailed) with the simple administrative boundary (baltimore_city), and created layers for the buffered areas and labels.\n\n# Set family and size for text labels\nupdate_geom_defaults(\"text\", list(family = \"Roboto Condensed\", size = 4))\n\nlayer_city &lt;- list(\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city_detailed, fill = NA, color = \"gray80\"),\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city, fill = NA, color = \"gray60\")\n)\n\nlayer_dist &lt;- geom_sf(data = area_dist, fill = NA, color = \"gray70\", linetype = \"dotted\", linewidth = 0.65)\n\nlayer_label &lt;- geom_sf_text(data = area_label, aes(label = label), color = \"gray20\")\n\nggplot() +\n  layer_city +\n  geom_sf(data = area) +\n  layer_dist +\n  layer_label\n\n\n\n\nFor the next step, we need the locations for the libraries. Open Baltimore provides access to a GeoJSON file with the location of the Central Library and all of the branches which I can quickly import using the read_sf function.\n\nlibraries_path &lt;- \"https://gisdata.baltimorecity.gov/egis/rest/services/OpenBaltimore/Library/FeatureServer/0\"\n\nlibraries &lt;- sfext::read_sf_esri(libraries_path) %&gt;%\n  janitor::clean_names(\"snake\") %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform(2804)\n\nIt looks fine but the label placement is a bit tricky—especially in the city’s dense southeast Baltimore neighborhoods there are a few libraries very close together.\n\nlibraries %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  layer_city +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = name), nudge_y = 550) +\n  geom_sf(data = area)\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid these overlapping labels and try out a more distinctive style, I decided to divide up the libraries into three groups—libraries in east and northeast Baltimore (mostly), libraries in north and northwest Baltimore (mostly), and libraries everywhere else.\n\nlibraries_e &lt;- libraries %&gt;%\n  filter(name %in% c(\"Southeast Anchor\", \"Canton\", \"Herring Run\", \"Hamilton\", \"Northwood\", \"Clifton\", \"Govans\"))\n\nlibraries_nw &lt;- libraries %&gt;%\n  filter(name %in% c(\"Central\", \"Waverly\", \"Forest Park\", \"Reisterstown\", \"Orleans\", \"Roland Park\", \"Hampden\", \"Walbrook\"))\n\nlibraries_s &lt;- libraries %&gt;%\n  filter(!(name %in% c(libraries_nw$name, libraries_e$name)))\n\nI should be clear that figuring out which library belonged in which group took a bit of trial and error. I’m using the hjust parameter to left align the text for libraries in northeast and east Baltimore then right align everything else and I’m using the angle, nudge_x, and nudge_y parameters to push the text to the appropriate side of the diamond shape I used to mark each library location.\n\n# Use geom_sf_text to make each group of libraries into a separate layer\nnudge &lt;- 275\n\n# Reduce the text size\nupdate_geom_defaults(\"text\", list(size = 2.75))\n\nlayer_libraries_e &lt;- geom_sf_text(\n  data = libraries_e,\n  aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)),\n  nudge_x = nudge, nudge_y = nudge * -1, angle = -45, hjust = 0\n)\n\nlayer_libraries_nw &lt;- geom_sf_text(\n  data = libraries_nw,\n  aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)),\n  nudge_x = nudge * -1, nudge_y = nudge, angle = -45, hjust = 1\n)\n\nlayer_libraries_s &lt;- geom_sf_text(\n  data = libraries_s,\n  aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)),\n  nudge_x = nudge * -1, nudge_y = nudge * -1, angle = 45, hjust = 1\n)\n\nggplot() +\n  # Add labels\n  layer_city +\n  layer_dist +\n  layer_libraries_e +\n  layer_libraries_nw +\n  layer_libraries_s +\n  geom_sf(data = libraries, shape = 5, size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nI exported the finished map with ggsave, printed it out, and checked off the two libraries we’ve visited so far. This morning, my daughter circled one more. She had mentioned our new map to her math teacher and, after her teacher told her which branch she usually uses and gave it a good review, my daughter started making a plan for us to visit this weekend. I can’t wait.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2021,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Making a Map of Libraries Around My Neighborhood},\n  date = {2021-03-23},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2021-03-23-mapping-libraries-near-me},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2021. “Making a Map of Libraries Around My\nNeighborhood.” March 23, 2021. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2021-03-23-mapping-libraries-near-me."

    "text": "With the help of a new Kindle last winter, I’ve finished more books in 2011 than I have in years and I thought I might share a few recommendations and highlights. I’ve been especially excited to discover my own love of historical fiction. In the past year I read the first three novels in the Flashman series by George MacDonald Fraser, the three Baroque Cycle novels by Neal Stephenson, and both The Anubis Gates and Declare by Tim Powers. Although Neal Stephenson and Tim Powers freely mix historical with fantastical details and characters, I was thrilled by how both authors managed to pull me into a version of the past and create a rich sense of place through their writing.\nWhile fiction peaked my interest in European history over the summer, I found my way back to U.S. history with The Whites of Their Eyes by Jill Lepore, followed by 1491 and 1493 by Charles Mann. All three are accessible histories without abandoning any rigor or credibility – the footnotes are excellent – and offer inspiring departures from the structural constraints of more traditional narrative histories. Jill Lepore’s work does this particularly well as she weaves together the threads of contemporary Tea Party politics, the public memorialization of the Revolutionary War during the 1970s, and unique insights into the lives of Revolutionary period men and women from Thomas Paine to Ben Franklin’s sister Jane Mecom (a topic the author highlighted in a New York Times opinion piece Poor Jane’s Almanac). The concluding passage from the book’s prologue (available for download as a PDF) took my breath away with its evocative and visceral expression of the connections between the past and the present:\n\nStanding on the Beaver watching sea-weedy waves slap the ship’s hull, I thought about how sailors on ocean-faring vessels once measured depth. They would drop a rope weighted with lead into the water and let it plummet till it reached bottom. I like to sink lines, too, to get to the bottom of things. This book is an argument against historical fundamentalism. It makes that argument by measuring the distance between the past and the present. It measures that distance by taking soundings in the ocean of time. Here, now, we float on a surface of yesterdays. Below swirls the blue-green of childhood. Deeper still is the obscurity of long ago. But the eighteenth century, oh, the eighteenth century lies fathoms down.\n\nCharles Mann, unlike Jill Lepore, is not an academic historian but does a tremendous job allowing the work of dozens of scholars to lead the way in 1491 as he tells stories about the presence of American Indians in the Americas before (and after) contact with Europe. These stories of agricultural practices, disease epidemics, and more of the past are placed in a context of debates and discussion between archaeologists, anthropologists, historians, activists and others over the last 50 years or more. In his introduction he suggested a partial inspiration for the book came in response to the woeful failure of school textbooks to capture any of these recent debates and discoveries:\n\nThe 1987 edition of American History: A Survey, a standard high school textbook by three well-known historians, summed up Indian history thusly: “For thousands of centuries—centuries in which human races were evolving, forming communities, and building the beginnings of national civilizations in Africa, Asia, and Europe—the continents we know as the Americas stood empty of mankind and itsworks.” The story of Europeans in the NewWorld, the book informed students, “is the story of the creation of a civilization where none existed.”\nMeanwhile, new disciplines and new technologies were creating new ways to examine the past. Demography, climatology, epidemiology, economics, botany, and palynology (pollen analysis); molecular and evolutionary biology; carbon-14 dating, ice-core sampling, satellite photography, and soil assays; genetic microsatellite analysis and virtual 3-D fly-throughs—a torrent of novel perspectives and techniques cascaded into use. And when these were employed, the idea that the only human occupants of one-third of the earth’s surface had changed little for thousands of years began to seem implausible. To be sure, some researchers have vigorously attacked the new findings as wild exaggerations. (“We have simply replaced the old myth [of untouched wilderness] with a new one,” scoffed geographer Thomas Vale, “the myth of the humanized landscape.”) But after several decades of discovery and debate, a new picture of the Americas and their original inhabitants is emerging.\n\nNot convinced you must read 1491 yet? Check out this March 2002 piece in The Atlantic for a tight introduction to the book’s themes. While a bit less revelatory for me, 1493 is still packed with fascinating details on quilombos, better known in the U.S. as maroon communities, like Palmares, the appalling conditions for Chinese workers guano mining in Peru, the fiscal implications of the Spanish galleon trade in Europe and Asia and much more. NPR offers a good excerpt of the book to get you started.\nI’m currently reading Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson so I hope to share another review of sorts in the next few weeks. For a bit of inspiration closer to home, check out READTHATCITY for a few local history recommendation and a new community of neighbors (The Greatest Book Club in America) who’ll be reading along with you in 2012.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Reading Historical Fiction and Histories in 2011},\n  date = {2012-02-18},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-02-18-reading-historical-fiction-and-histories-in-2011},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “Reading Historical Fiction and Histories in\n2011.” February 18, 2012. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-02-18-reading-historical-fiction-and-histories-in-2011."

    "text": "This spring, I’ll be presenting a paper at the 2018 Vernacular Architectural Forum on the meaning, history, and politics of demolition in Baltimore. My presentation is part of a panel, “Erasure in the Urban Vernacular Landscape,” with Susan Garfinkel, David Rotenstein, and Aaron Wunsch.\nI’ve already done some research and writing on demolition for Project CORE (see my posts for Baltimore Heritage on the 2016 and 2017 demolition review process). With this paper, I’m hoping to look closer at the recent history of demolition in Baltimore (from the 1970s through the 2000s), conduct a few interviews with residents and policy-makers, and get a better understanding of the neighborhood and urban politics of demolition. If you’re a Baltimore resident and you are interested in talking about your experiences with demolition, please get in touch by email or on Twitter! I’m also sharing project photos on Instagram using the hashtag #baltimoredemolition. Read on for my abstract and I’ll try to share updates as I put together a draft over the next few months.\n\nDecades of demands by local residents and policy-makers to “fix up or tear down” vacant rowhouses in Baltimore, Maryland are expanding under Project CORE, a new program created in 2016 to provide millions in new state funding for local demolition priorities. While the program includes grant funding for stabilization and rehabilitation, the main goal is to erase blocks and blocks of the “blighted” mostly vacant rowhouses concentrated in the historically segregated districts of east and west Baltimore.\n\n\n\nDemolition of vacant rowhouses, 1100 block of E. Hoffman Street, Baltimore, MD 21202, 2017 November 21.\n\n\nTearing down old buildings while following state and federal preservation law and giving legal due process to private property owners, however, is more complicated than elected officials acknowledge when they promise to make the problems of the past disappear. What room do the politics and policy of demolition leave for residents to mourn the loss of a building or neighborhood? How do residents and advocates envision the benefits of demolition?\n\n\n\nDemolition/deconstruction of vacant rowhouses, 1100 block of E. Hoffman Street, Baltimore, MD 21202, 2017 November 29.\n\n\nIn this presentation, I use research on Baltimore’s history of vacancy and demolition and interviews with contemporary neighborhood advocates and public administrations to explain how demolition is experienced and made meaningful by Baltimoreans and their local government.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2017,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {The Politics of “Tear It down”},\n  date = {2017-11-30},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-11-30-tear-it-down},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2017. “The Politics of ‘Tear It\ndown’.” November 30, 2017. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-11-30-tear-it-down."

    "text": "Gary Cooper and Babe Ruth ride a bike, 1942.\n\n\nThis whole thing should be considered a working draft. It is back-dated to the last major revision in December 2013. Some of the different accounts of Babe Ruth in Fayetteville are contradictory and confusing - more work is really needed to parse through the variations on the stories involving the bicycle. Another version of this post that includes the footnotes can be found in this Google Doc.\nBabe Ruth never owned a bicycle growing up in Baltimore. Born at his grandfather’s modest rowhouse on Emory Street in 1895, George Herman Ruth spent his first several years moving here and there in southwest Baltimore. At age seven, he entered St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys - a reformatory and orphanage on Wilkens Avenue established in 1866. At St. Mary’s, George learned to play baseball and at in early 1914 signed a contract with Jack Dunn, the owner and manager of the Baltimore Orioles.\nBy March, George and his teammates had arrived in Fayetteville, North Carolina where he started his life-long love of bicycles. On a Wednesday evening, March 18, 1914 - a little over a week since his first game in professional baseball - George hurried out after dinner to meet a new acquaintance - one of a handful of local boys who biked out to the field to watch the Orioles train. That afternoon, the boy had offered George a chance to borrow his bike after dinner and George lept at the opportunity.\nWhile biking through town and gaining a bit of confidence, Babe Ruth decided to show off. He rode past the hotel where the Orioles had been staying, riding on the wrong side of the road and waving to a group of teammates out front. His teammates saw what George did not – a large truck bearing down on the novice cyclist.\nAnother account from Babe: The Legend Comes to Life by Robert W. Creame descibes a similar incident:\n\n“One day, barreling around a corner, he missed running head-on into Dunn and Egan only by braking violently and twisting the bike to one side. He smacked into the back of a wagon and ended up on the ground, the bike draped around him, grinning at Dunn with cheerful embarrassment. Dunn looked at him sourly and said,”If you want to go back to the Home, kid, just keep riding those bicycles.”\n\nIn a minor variation on this theme, Allan Wood quotes Dunn as shouting, “You wanna go back to that school? You’re a ballplayer, not a goddman circus act!”\nAfter another bicycle accident soon followed, Orioles scout Sam Steinman remarked to sportswriter Roger Pippen, “If Dunn doesn’t shackle that new babe of his, he won’t be a Rube Waddell in the rough, he’ll be a babe Ruth in the cemetery.” Pippen’s next article for the Baltimore American, published March 19, 1914, described a “young fledgling” ball player with the name “Babe Ruth” - the first time the nickname appeared in print.\nWhen the regular season began in late April, the Orioles returned to Baltimore. Like all the players, Ruth received food and lodging during the spring training but did not get paid until the regular season began. When Ruth received his first paycheck, the first purchase he made was a bicycle. According to his recollections from The Babe Ruth Story, told to Bob Considine, Babe later shared:\n\n“I went out and celebrated, just as soon as I got my first paycheck - $100. I bought a bicycle, something that I had wanted and often prayed for through most of my young life. Most of the Orioles, of course, had cars, but none of them was as proud as I was, riding the first possession of my life through the old streets of Baltimore.”\n\nIn his book, Robert Creamer contradicted Ruth’s recollections reporting the envelop had only $50 but still “more money than Ruth had ever seen” but reflected on the new bicycle writing: “Tooling around Baltimore on it, [Ruth] felt richer than God.”\n\n\n\nPhoto is unsourced and unconfirmed that it is even Babe Ruth but is included in this forum thread as Babe Ruth on a bicycle in Baltimore in 1914.\n\n\nRuth’s history of collisions continued even after he bought the new bike (he bought a motorcycle and a car soon after). Newark pitcher Al Schacht was run down by bicycle ridden by a “gangling, moon-face kid” with a handful of hotdogs. Schacht yelled, “Why the hell don’t you watch where you’re going, Rube?” The “kid” replied “Sorry, mister, I almost dropped a hotdog and my hand slipped.” Schacht was even more surprised a short time later when he spotted the kid on the field wearing the Orioles uniform.\nA few years later, just days after Babe Ruth and the Red Sox won the World Series in Boston, Ruth picked up his share of the winnings and spent the evening as the official “starter” for bike and motorcycle races at the Revere Beach track.\nIronically, Ruth’s success and the growing popularity of baseball eclipsed the long-standing interest in bicycle racing that made professional cyclists some of the highest paid athletes in the United States in the early 20th century. The circumstances had been quite the opposite a few decades earlier when, after the invention of the safety bicycle in 1885, cycling experienced a boom in popularity that rivaled baseball and even threatened attendance at the games:\n\n“The owners also tried to capitalize on the bicycle craze of the ’nineties, but without financial success. According to Al Reach, thousands of dollars were lost in laying out tracks for bike races in many of the baseball parks.”\n\n\nOne final note - I pulled this quote from some memoir but now I can’t find the source. Frustrating!\n\nWhen we got outside, Babe looked around frantically for a taxi but there wasn’t one on the street. Suddenly, two kids on bikes came pedaling around the corner. Babe jumped in front of them, and they hit their brakes so they wouldn’t crash into him.\n“Hey, kids, how much for the bicycles?” asked Babe.\n“Huh?” the kids said.\n“Here,” Babe said, pulling a $20 bill out of his pocket….\n“Y’know how to ride a bicycle?” Babe asked me.\n“Well, sure…”\n“Then let’s go!”\nBack when I visited him in 1932, Babe Ruth drove me to Wrigley Field in Chicago. I almost died. Well, he rode a bicycle the same way– like a maniac. He took off and started pedaling furiously, weaving around street vendors, potholes and garbage cans. Little old ladies were diving out of his way. Cars were honking at him, and I wasn’t sure if it was…\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2013,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{If} You Want to Go Back the {Home,} Kid, Just Keep Riding\n    Those Bicycles.”},\n  date = {2013-12-04},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2013-12-04-if-you-want-to-go-back-the-home-kid-just-keep-riding-those-bicycles},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2013. “‘If You Want to Go Back the Home, Kid,\nJust Keep Riding Those Bicycles.’” December 4, 2013. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2013-12-04-if-you-want-to-go-back-the-home-kid-just-keep-riding-those-bicycles."

    "text": "Photograph of Libby Bark, Ida Konig, and Eve (later Topel) in front of Princeton Cycle Company on Park Circle, c. 1938-40. Courtesy the Jewish Museum of Maryland, 1987.019.037.\n\n\nWhile researching Jewish history in northwest  Baltimore for a bike tour next weekend, I came across another interesting story from the history of Baltimore cycling - the story of a Park Circle bicycle shop (still operating in Baltimore County and Columbia as Princeton Sports) that did a brisk business renting bicycles to Jewish families and children around Druid Hill Park.\nLucille and Samuel Davis arrived in Baltimore from Princeton, New Jersey in 1936 and opened the Princeton Cycle Company at 3301 Park Circle renting single-speed, foot-braked Schwinn cruisers to individuals and couples around Druid Hill Park. In Jewish Baltimore: A Family Album (2000), Gilbert Sandler sketches a warm picture of the corner - a busy streetcar junction with an A&W Hot Shoppe, a Little Tavern Hamburger, and Mr. Davis’s Cycle Shop:\n\nOn Sunday mornings, the neighborhood’s young people would rent bikes from Mr. Davis’s Cycle Shop. By ten o’clock on any fine sunny Sunday morning, all of Mr. Davis’s bicycles were rented out, including his only “bicycle built for two.” The cyclers rode every path of the park, down to what is now the Reptile House, past the Zoo up to what teenagers knew as “Prospect Hill,” and as far as the tennis courts and swimming pool.\n\nJust a couple years after opening their shop, they won a concession from the Baltimore Parks Department to open a bicycle rental stand near Druid Lake, then - like today - a popular area for cycling. The stand remained open through 1947 renting bikes by the day or the hour. In Glimpses of Jewish Baltimore (2012), Sandler quotes an interview with Samuel and Lucille’s son - Bernard “Sonny” Davis:\n\nI started working there when I was eight years old – my father opened at Park Circle in 1936 and left the area in 1951. At our Park Circle shop we had as many as fifty bikes out at one time – and far more at our location in Druid Hill Park near the reservoir. We charged twenty-five cents an hour, and we were the first in our business to offer bikes with training wheels so kids and moms could keep up with dads.Amazingly, we did big business after 11:00 pm, when the waiters and waitresses getting of work at the Hot Shoppe would start their midnight  bike riding in the park.\n\nThe center of Baltimore’s Jewish community continued to move northwest and the couple moved with it - closing their Park Circle shop in 1951 and re-opening as a sporting goods store on Park Heights Avenue in 1952. When Samuel Davis died in 1963, “Sonny” Davis and his mother, Lucille continued the business - moving the shop to Falls Road in Baltimore County in 1970. In 1981, Sonny’s own son Alan Davis came on to open a new location in Columbia. I’d love to reach out to the family at some point and learn more about the history of the original shop - the building still stands as far as I can tell but it feels like there is more to the story than has been told here.\n\n\n\nBernard “Sonny” Davis in 1991, photo courtesy The Baltimore Sun bow-607.\n\n\nAdditional Sources\n\n“Lucille Davis Ran Princeton Sports,” November 22, 1990, The Baltimore Sun\nTaNoah Morgan, “Family firm is big wheel in sporting goods retailing: Sales growing despite increased competition,” October 15, 2001, The Baltimore Sun\nBarry Kessler, Druid Hill Park: Jewish Baltimore’s Green Oasis - 1920-1960, The Baltimore Jewish Environmental Network\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Riding Bicycles from {Mr.} {Davis’s} {Cycle} {Shop} at {Park}\n    {Circle}},\n  date = {2012-10-07},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-10-07-riding-bicycles-from-mr-daviss-cycle-shop-at-park-circle},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “Riding Bicycles from Mr. Davis’s Cycle Shop\nat Park Circle.” October 7, 2012. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-10-07-riding-bicycles-from-mr-daviss-cycle-shop-at-park-circle."

    "text": "I wrote this post back in May as a proposal for THATCamp Prime.\nAfter publishing a very specific proposal on the National Register nomination form a few days ago and then writing a whole new title up on the whiteboard this morning, I wanted to follow up with a second post to try to articulate a few of the broad questions that I hope we can discuss during the session on local digital history tomorrow morning. While I am excited by the many compelling projects presented by scholars at THATCamp, I am also concerned that many public historians and local historians–particularly in the context of small museums, historical societies, and preservation advocacy organizations–are not engaged in this conversation. Too many of these small institutions–institutions which I believe play a vital role in the interpretation and preservation of our shared heritage–are just struggling to build and maintain an effective online presence, let alone engage in more creative and innovative projects involving digitization, linked data, mobile technology, geodata, data visualization, augmented reality, etc. In addition, to the extent that a conversation between local historians and preservationists is taking place online at all, it is found largely on e-mail lists, e.g. H-DC, H-Maryland, and H-Local, rather than in the context of more public or accessible forums. The challenges for historic sites and heritage organizations seeking deeper engagement with digital technology include conservative institutional contexts, the limited digital literacy of many established local historians, and the pressing demands of programs and advocacy that might crowd out opportunities for innovation. If these barriers can be overcome, I believe there are clear opportunities for using digital media to develop deeper partnerships between scholars and practitioners, share best practices for low resource and limited capacity organizations, and experiment with new interpretive strategies linking multiple sites or themes.\nI’m hoping that others are concerned with these same issues and we can have a discussion that might outline both the challenges and opportunities for local digital historians in greater detail. For the “More hack, less yak” aspect of this session, I’d be curious if others might be interested in starting a group blog for local digital historians working in (or on) the broader Mid-Atlantic region. I’m imaging a place where we can highlight a few of the many interesting projects that are taking place in our neighborhoods, cities, and regions, share tools and methods, and just talk about all of the awesome historic places, people, and events that make up our shared local heritage.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2010,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Local {Digital} {History:} {Building} a Digital Community of\n    Local Historians and Preservationists in {the~Mid-Atlantic~Region}},\n  date = {2010-08-13},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-13-local-digital-history-building-a-digital-community-of-local-historians-and-preservationists-in-the-mid-atlantic-region},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2010. “Local Digital History: Building a Digital\nCommunity of Local Historians and Preservationists in\nthe Mid-Atlantic Region.” August 13, 2010. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-13-local-digital-history-building-a-digital-community-of-local-historians-and-preservationists-in-the-mid-atlantic-region."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our project on Baltimore’s Civil Rights Heritage is supported by the Maryland Historical Trust, the National Park Service, and PNC. This post is a draft of an essay recorded for Humanities Connection on WYPR in 2017.\n\nIt is easy to forget that the Civil Rights movement did not begin in the basement of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where Martin Luther King, Jr. and others organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. It is easy to forget that the movement did not end in 1968 on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. It is easy to forget but, as Baltimore’s own Frederick Douglass reminded his audience in 1884:\n\n“It is not well to forget the past. Memory was given to man for some wise purpose. The past is the mirror in which we may discern the dim outlines of the future.”\n\nWe’ve kept his words in mind, as Baltimore Heritage and our partners documented the local history of the Civil Rights movement for the National Register of Historic Places. We’re looking at books, letters, and old photographs. But we’re also looking at the churches, homes, parks, and street corners where the history of the movement took place.\nToday, Baltimore remembers Frederick Douglass with statues at Morgan State University and at a waterfront park at the western end of Thames Street. The Aliceanna Street house where Douglass lived before escaping from slavery in 1838 is gone. You can still visit the 500 block of South Dallas Street in Fell’s Point and see a group of rowhouses Douglass built in 1892.\nPeople all around the country remember Douglass’ story. As a historian, I’m always grateful to people who remember.\nMembers of Union Baptist Church remember their former pastor Reverend Harvey Johnson and his wife Amelia E. Hall, an influential Afro-Canadian writer. In the 1880s, Johnson founded the Brotherhood of Liberty, one of the earliest Civil Rights groups in the nation. He fought for Civil Rights in the city’s courtrooms, writing: “there must be Negro lawyers, men who have themselves suffered and who will fight the people’s fight, because the people’s fight will be their own battle.” In 1905, Johnson built the sancturary for Union Baptist Church on Druid Hill Avenue where the congregation continues to worship today.\nLong-time residents of Morgan Park in northeast Baltimore remember their former neighbor W.E.B. Du Bois. He visited Baltimore regularly in the early 1900s, seeking advice on organizing and activism from Rev. Johnson at Union Baptist. In 1905, Du Bois wrote: “We claim for ourselves every right that belongs to a freeborn American—political, civil and social—and until we get these rights, we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of America with the story of its shameful deeds toward us.” In 1939, Du Bois and his wife Nina built a house on Montebello Terrace in Morgan Park. After Nina’s death in 1950, DuBois split his time between Baltimore and New York before leaving the United States for Ghana in 1962.\nLocal politicians both black and white, remember Victorine Q. Adams. She started her work in politics in the 1940s. She established the Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee to support politicians who opposed segregation and discrimination and the group, Woman Power, to get more black women involved in politics. At her home in Hanlon Park, Adams set up a voting machine and taught hundreds of black Baltimoreans how to vote for change. Finally, in 1968, Adams moved into a new office at Baltimore’s City Hall as the first black woman elected to the City Council.\nEveryone in Baltimore remembers the 2015 protests at the Western District Police Station following Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Through our research, we’ve learned that activists have a long history at the Mount Street police station. Activists picketed outside to protest police violence in 1966, 1969, 1972, and 1980.\nWe want to know what you remember about Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote this post back in 2010 but took it down after judging it a bit too personal and not my strongest writing. I recently received a comment from someone who grew up in Arcola Knolls looking for more information about the development so I wanted to re-post with a few minor edits from the original.\n\n\n\n“Plat 6353, Arcola Knolls, Blocks A-B; William Cohen and Charles Cohen,” June 20, 1961.\n\n\nThere are many modest vernacular examples of mid-century modern design in the Washington, DC suburbs that often go overlooked in favor of more iconic, innovative, or controversial buildings. My own appreciation for the vernacular modernism of Maryland’s post-WWII subdivisions, gas stations, auto garages, and municipal buildings arrived gradually during the three years I lived in a 1962 split-level in the Arcola Knolls subdivision at the edge of Wheaton Regional Park. Although not quite as stylish as the homes in nearby Hammond Wood designed by Charles M. Goodman, Arcola Knolls testifies to a fascinating period in regional history as rapid residential development encouraged local architects, developers, and home-buyers to experiment with contemporary architectural design.\n\n\n\n“Young Builders Go Contemporary,” March 31, 1962\n\n\nJo-Rich Developers, Inc. began work on Arcola Knolls in 1961 with the subdivision of the former agricultural property into 11 lots along Arcola and Orebaugh Avenues. Jo-Rich Developers, Inc. grew out of the friendship between builders Joseph Bonnett and Richard Cohen, just 27 and 21 years old when they began the project. Bonnett, a veteran and married father of two, planned to move his own family into the project upon completion while Cohen still lived with his parents in the North Portal Estates neighborhood of Washington, DC. Bonnett described the design of Arcola Knolls as “striking and daring in the contemporary style,” featuring a “post and beam effect, exceptional window space and adaptation to indoor-outdoor living.” Each house included four bedrooms and three baths, and was listed for sale by N.S. Bryer, Inc. for $28,950.\nIn April 1962, Jo-Rich Developers advertised the small development as “Silver Spring’s Most Contemporary Community,” emphasizing its proximity to churches, Northwood High School (1956), Wheaton Library (1962), and Wheaton Plaza (1959). With the rapid growth of Wheaton in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the adjoining Wheaton Park served as a pocket of wilderness, described in a Washington Post headline: “Verdant Island Rises in the Suburbs.” The Post noted that when “asked how the county managed to save the plot from homebuilders,” a Maryland National Capitol Parks and Planning official said simply, “‘We got there first.’”\nArchitect John Arnold d’Epagnier (1913-1977) graduated from Catholic University with a B.Arch. in 1936 and by the 1950s maintained an office in the recently transformed Cissel-Lee building in Silver Spring. Previous examples of his residential design included “The Presidential,” a 1955 model home in Burnt Mills Estates, a “community of contemporary homes…to appeal to the modern-minded young families.” In addition to residential architecture, d’Epagnier designed a wide range of commercial structures and religious buildings including the Ohev Sholom Talmud Torah synagogue at 16th & Jonquil Streets NW, and St. John the Baptist Parish in Colesville, a congregation to which he also belonged.\n\n\n\nClassified Advertisement, September 2, 1962\n\n\nd’Epagnier’s design for Arcola Knolls evidently proved popular as Jo-Rich sold all eleven homes within a few short months. My own grandparents purchased a home at the end of Orebaugh Avenue in 1962 and remained there for over forty years. My grandfather was a mechanical engineer working for the Department of the Navy and my Mom recalls that the modern architecture held a lot of appeal.\nUnfortunately, Jo-Rich Development abandoned modern architecture on their few subsequent project, building low-slung Colonials in Montrose Park, Bethesda. Joseph Bonnett went with Dutch Colonial dwellings designed by architect Morton Noble for his late-1960s development, Hearthstone Square. In 1973, Richard Cohen went on to take over Wilco Companies - a commercial real estate development firm started by his father Charles Cohen in the early 1960s with investment from the sale of his two successful prior enterprises the Capitol Trash Company and the Normandy Cup Company. The firm remains a large  commercial real estate development and investment firm in the Washington, DC area.\nArcola Knolls, the project where Richard Cohen’s development career began, where my grandparents bought a house and my mother grew up, remains a stand-out example of vernacular modernism in the Maryland suburbs.\n\nSources\n“California Contemporary Homes Open Next Week.” The Washington Post and Times Herald (1954-1959), May 8, 1955.

The Post Office was designed in 1968 by Tatar & Kelly - a partnership of Seymour Tatar & W. Boulton Kelly - with Cochran, Stephenson & Donkervoet serving as associate architects. Further examples Tatar & Kelly can be found in modern buildings from the Enoch Pratt Free Library - Reisterstown Road Branch (1967), Steuart Hill Elementary School (1969) at Union Square, and the Baltimore County Public Library - Towson Branch (1974).\nThe builder, McCloskey-Leavell from Philadelphia, also developed the property under a build-lease scheme where the post office was built by a private enterprise, giving the federal government a lease and a later option to purchase. When the new building opened in 1972, the Post Office invested $5 million in new equipment with 4,000 employees. A 1971 account in The Baltimore Sun heralded the development as an anchor for the Shot Tower Industrial Park – a 24-acre area bounded by Colvin Street, Fayette Street, the Fallsway and Orleans Street.\n\n\n\nBaltimore Museum of Industry, BG&E Print and Negative Collection, BGE.47525, 10/19/1971"

    "title": "We have a problem with vacant houses in Baltimore. Part two of two.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is Part Two of my paper for the Vernacular Architecture Forum Conference in Chicago. Part one is located here. This particular section is adapted from another post I published last summer.\nA final example from 1910 illustrates the difficulty that many residents and elected official experienced in trying to come to terms with the causes of vacant  houses. Some observers clearly saw how suburban growth at the periphery and disinvestment from the core drove Baltimore’s emerging vacant house problem. However, then and perhaps now, anxiety over high property taxes, worries over diminished property values and white supremacy largely defined the terms of the debate. Rather than challenge the enormous public subsidies for suburban growth or encourage more substantial investment in the maintenance of older city neighborhoods (by then occupied largely by recent immigrants and African Americans), the city instead fought vacancy by writing racism into local housing laws.\nIn August 1910, a member of the real estate firm of William Martien & Company who shared a growing “agitation over the number of vacant houses in the city,” asked the Baltimore Police board to undertake a “complete census of the number of houses, both vacant and occupied in the city.” With the release of the report, real estate agent James Cary Martien argued, “The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore.”\nMartien’s focus on housing supply and demand neglected to account for the intense concern that many Baltimoreans had with racial segregation - advancing the necessity of segregation on the principle of white supremacy and the economic logic of preserving property values. In the weeks that followed the publication of the report, a series of letters to the Sun expanded on Martien’s summary and tied vacancy closely to the perceived threat of “negro invasion.”\nFor example, when some residents argued that high taxes contributed to housing abandonment, one northwest Baltimore resident wrote back under the name “Pure White” arguing that the “negro neighbor is the main reason.” The letter, published on August 27, 1910, continued:\n\n“When a man works and saves and buys a home thinking it will be his shelter in his old age, and wakes up some morning to find he has a negro neighbor, he feels hurt and aggrieved that he has to give up his home, but he moves. […] I know of three families who want to buy a home this fall and they prefer the city to the suburbs, but they are hesitating because of this disagreeable possibility. […] The real estate men—a few of them, not all—are to blame for the vacant houses and with them, lies the remedy.”\n\nOn September 2, 1910, a letter signed by “Justice” echoed this sentiment and with a demand that the city to protect his neighborhood from “invasion” and vacant houses writing:\n“There are several vacant houses in the block, and this fear may be the potent cause of non-rental or sale. Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest. We live in daily dread that we may be driven out and forced to sell at a depreciated price if we can sell at all.”\nA third resident, writing on September 15, 1910, framed the issue as clearly distinct from the seasonal vacancy of the past several decades or vacancy created by the passing uncertainty of a transitioning neighborhood:\n\n“The vacant house problem in the city should be one of grave concern at this time to our municipal administrators, to our real estate agents and to those having the welfare of the city at heart. It is not a temporary but a growing evil that is confronting and threatening every owner of property. The number of vacant houses has grown and grown until at last there is common alarm in the matter, and justly so. What then are the causes producing this condition? There are many, but the fundamental one is purely economic—high taxes.”\n\nResidents like “Pure White” and “Justice” won a victory on December 20, 1910, when Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West who represented the northwestern neighborhood highlighted in the police report for the highest concentration of vacant houses.\nThe new law was the first local ordinance in the country to enforce racial segregation in housing as it forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” Each block was designated according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910 and the city police were tasked with enforcing the new policy.\nWhile the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, it was followed by several more  attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation. Often overlooked in this much-discussed chapter of Baltimore’s history of segregation, vacant housing played a critical role in stoking white fears and reinforcing a racialized perception of “blight” in the decades that followed.\nThe effort to promote racial segregation ultimately did little to address the structural issues around taxes and infrastructure costs that continued to promote disinvestment up until the beginning of WWI. This period also saw the emerging concern with the visibility of vacant houses as a symbol of the city’s perceived decline.  One letter, published on on March 5, 1912 and signed by “Belle Baltimore,” decried the sight of vacant houses as the city prepared to celebrate the Centennial of the Battle of Baltimore in 1914:\n\n“While we are cleaning house to welcome visitors to Baltimore in June, there is one very offensive spectacle we should strive to remove. It is the sight of so many residences on our best avenues, vacant, dead and decaying houses, with staring, grimy windows covered with signs ‘For Rent’ or ‘For Sale,’ like ghastly invitations to a funeral.”\n\n“Belle Baltimore” continued to complain about burdensome taxes required to support the investment in the suburban Annex where  “speculative builders” erected “row of these sardine boxes” that make Baltimore “more and more like a model workhouse or prison every year.” The letter concludes with a tone of finality:\n\n“To escape unjust taxation people of means are taking refuge in apartments or in the suburbs…. Does not this state of things savor a little of the knights of the road, who became popular heroes by ‘robbing the rich to serve the poor?’ One thing is certain: Well-to-do people will shun cities infested by such gentry. Because of it Baltimore is already like a tree rotten at the core.”\n\nIn 1914, with the start of World War II, debates over vacant housing retreated as the home building industry ground to near complete halt. Construction permits for new dwellings in Baltimore dwindled from 2,484 in 1916, to 885 in 1917, and just 378 in 1918. During World War II, concern over blight often focused on housing “congestion” rather than vacancy, although clearly the issue remained present. After World War II, and throughout the period of urban renewal into the 1970s, the predecessors of today’s vacant house policies took shape. Over the past few decades, the scale and scope of issues around vacant houses has continued to grow.\n[\nToday, advocates for historic preservation and community development struggle to secure public support for substantial reinvestment in historic urban cores. Legacy city leaders from Detroit to Cleveland to Baltimore have retreated from what seemed to be an unattainable agenda of regional governance and adequate funding for affordable housing. Instead, we see strategic demolition and “blight elimination” championed as a short-term necessity in neighborhoods like Sandtown Winchester.\nJust as the city experienced a century ago, many people want to define the city’s challenges as a “vacant house problem” - locating the issue in low-income African American communities alone. This definition places the sole responsibility to solve to problem on those residents, rather than acknowledging the complicity of Baltimore’s broader system of spatial inequality. Let’s work to make sure the next century offers a new definition of the “vacant house problem” and a new set of solutions.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {We Have a Problem with Vacant Houses in {Baltimore.} {Part}\n    Two of Two.},\n  date = {2015-05-12},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-05-12-we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-two-of-two},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “We Have a Problem with Vacant Houses in\nBaltimore.

    "text": "I’m a devoted listener of the short podcast The Memory Palace, created and produced by Nate DiMeo. If you haven’t heard the show before, a few of my favorites include The Messrs. Craft-- the incredible story of Ellen and William Craft’s escape from slavery to freedom, OMG!!! JKP!!!-- a fast-paced lesson on President James K. Polk, and the tragic 400 Words for 79th Street. For me, part of the show’s appeal has always been how it works as both an engaging podcast and an example of accessible public history. I was intrigued to read Nate DiMeo’s behind the scenes look at the production of the show contrasting his approach to story telling with a narrower approach that might be more typical for historians–\n\nOn my way out the door, I pitched a concept for a weekly, hour-long history show to the powers that were at American Public Media. Part of this was pragmatic: there’re shows about nearly every big humanities category—art, books, religion/philosophy, auto-repair, music—but, at the time, no one was doing a history show. It felt like an opportunity missed. My theory then (which I still buy, I think) was that people who love history enough to try to start a history show were…wait for it…historians. And historians are specialists. They like depth. They fear reductivism. They love details. And they often produce great radio. But if you tune into a program and hear that it’s all going to be about the Korean War and you don’t think you care about the Korean War, you will turn it off and turn on your audiobook of Freedom (you are a public radio listener after all).\nI am not a historian. I cannot even claim to be a history buff. But, jeeze, do I love a good story. And history is, at its core, just a bunch of stories. I figured if you remembered that, if you placed an emphasis on narrative, and drama, and amazing facts, and wonder, and kept things varied and kept things moving and kept things short, you could build a general-interest history show that the person tooling around on a Saturday could enjoy as much as any of the other weekend, public radio crowd-pleasers. Or their reruns.\n\nI think his comments on historians hit close to home. I know I struggle to share stories from my own historical research without dwelling too long on the details and losing sight of what really makes the story interesting. BackStory with the American History Guys (another tremendous public history radio program produced by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities) manages avoid excluding diverse audiences in part through its focus on seasonal themes and current affairs – listen to 2010’s Beyond Numbers: A History of the U.S. Census or 2008’s Panic!: A History of Financial Crisis for good examples. With The Memory Palace, Nate DiMeo consistently offers fresh narratives and structures that connect compelling true stories to layers of voice and music that truly provide a visceral sense of wonder for the experiences of people in the past. The rest of his post on the show at transom.org reveals the project to be a labor of love with meager financial rewards, but I sincerely appreciate his effort to build and engage audiences around historical stories. If you’re curious to hear it for yourself, download the podcast at The Memory Palace and connect with the show on Twitter and Faceboook.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2011,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Why {I} Listen to {The} {Memory} {Palace}},\n  date = {2011-04-25},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-04-25-why-i-listen-to-the-memory-palace},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2011. “Why I Listen to The Memory Palace.”\nApril 25, 2011. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-04-25-why-i-listen-to-the-memory-palace."

    "text": "This post originally appeared as a proposal for THATCamp Prime 2010.\nI propose a discussion of the National Register of Historic Places nomination form to reimagine the potential of historical research and documentation in the context of abundance of digital tools for the investigation and presentation of architectural and social history. The National Register nomination form dates back to the enactment of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and continues to reflect the technical limitations and, arguably, the ideological assumptions of architectural history during the 1960s. The rise of vernacular architecture and cultural landscape studies have directly challenged the tradition of engaging buildings and neighborhoods with a curatorial approach based in an art history. Questions of style, significance, context, and integrity are now contested and complicated in ways that may be poorly reflected within the limits laid out in National Register Bulletin 16A “How to Complete The National Register Nomination Form.” Beyond the scholarly transformation of architectural and social history, the existing form has been disrupted by the transition from a culture of of scarcity to a culture of abundance described by Roy Rozenweig. The capacity to conduct full-text searches of manuscript census documents across hundreds of years with Ancestry.com, browse dozens of digitized directories on the Internet Archive, download measured drawings or archival photos from a good portion of HABS/HAER, determine the extant status of buildings using Google Maps, create three-dimensional models with Photosynth, and manage nearly unlimited sources with Zotero must force a radical reconsideration of the process of object of local history research and documentation. None of this was possible in 1966. If we started from scratch today, what would the National Register nomination form look like? I believe this question presents an opportunity to address engage with broader interests in linked data, social media, multimedia digital scholarship, geospatial data in the humanities, expanding scholarship to non-academic audiences, and the long-term preservation of digital work. To start here are a few specific examples of the limits and potential alternatives to the National Register nomination form,\n\nThe existing nomination form is largely textual, including a detailed written architectural descriptions. Could the supplementary documentation a National Register nomination include digital audio and video recordings of oral histories or historic events? 3D models of viewsheds? Datasets on demographic change at a block or neighborhood level?\nThe existing nomination form is clearly limited to a single author. How can attribution for collaborative authorship be addressed? Can a nomination be crowdsourced? How can alternate voices be integrated into the narrative? (CommentPress?)\nThe existing nomination form provides some structured data but it does not use a controlled vocabulary and fails to capture to dozens of references to building and architects found in the historic context of the nomination. Can  nominations be linked together with URIs that might represent architects, builders, owners, and buildings? (NC Architects & Builders?) Can unstructured natural language description be converted into semantic data? (OpenCalais?)\nThe existing nomination form provides a heading at the end of the form for a brief bibliography. Can RDF data be embedded in the nomination? Can references be linked directly to primary sources? (Document Cloud?)\n\nWhile my proposal for THATCamp Columbus provided a number of examples for historic places databases, a few more inspirational examples include NYC Landmarks, PhilaPlace (also addressed in Mark Tebeau’s session from Columbus), Wikipedia Saves Public Art, and the Brooklyn Typology. Admittedly the National Register has started digitizing and sharing images on Flickr and expanding access to past National Register Nomination forms through the much improved NPS Focus database but basic issues with the format of the nomination still remain. This post is a bit of a departure from my initial proposal but I hope it clearly engages with my stated interest in non-academic and non-scholarly audiences (and is not too link heavy to read).\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2010,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Reimagining the {National} {Register~Nomination~Form}},\n  date = {2010-08-12},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-12-reimagining-the-national-register nomination form},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2010. “Reimagining the National\nRegister Nomination Form.” August 12, 2010. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-12-reimagining-the-national-register nomination form."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is the first half of a paper I am working on for the 2015 Vernacular Architecture Forum conference in Chicago this June. The paper focuses on the history of vacant housing and demolition from the mid 19th to early 20th century. This is a draft so I’d welcome any initial thoughts, questions or suggestions.\n\nWe have a problem with vacant houses in Baltimore. A vacant might be a bank-owned brick townhouse from the 1970s; a narrow two-story rowhouse built for working-class whites in the 1910s; or a four-story 1870s mansion half-collapsed into the basement. Baltimore City estimates the city holds around 16,000 vacant properties – mostly attached rowhouses built before WWII.\nVisitors to Baltimore won’t find vacant houses in every neighborhood. In the largely white area of Hampden, Remington and Medfield, the vacancy rate is less than 1% – around sixty houses. In the West Baltimore neighborhoods of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park, over one-third of residential properties are vacant – totalling more than 2,000 vacant buildings.\nIt was in Sandtown on April 12 where a group of Baltimore police officers arrested Freddie Gray. A week later, Gray’s death from injuries he suffered in police custody sparked huge protests against police violence. Some residents marched and organized, others attacked local storefronts and burned police cars, prompting the city and state to bring in National Guard troops and impose a citywide curfew. Journalists from across the nation descended on Baltimore to write about the so-called “riots” and to ask the question: what’s the problem with Baltimore? How did the city get to be so poor, so violent and so segregated? Why does Baltimore have so many vacant houses?\nDespite the confident explanations offered in newspaper editorials and television reports, over the past few weeks, these are not easy questions to answer. Even when people in Baltimore try to explain our “vacant house problem,” the responses often are incomplete at best and misleading at worst.\nA professor at Johns Hopkins University might highlight Bethlehem Steel’s $1.5 billion loss in 1982 – a watershed in the city’s loss of good jobs to neoliberalism and globalization.\nA neighborhood activist in Druid Heights might point back to the unrest that rocked the city after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, leaving vacant lots and vacant buildings that have never recovered.\nA retiree living in Columbia who grew up shopping at downtown department stories may sadly recall when O’Neil’s Department Store closed the day after Christmas in 1955.\nAn amateur urban planner on Facebook might talk about how the city’s population peaked around 1 million in 1950 before falling more than a third to 620,961 in 2010.\nLimited as they are, each of these stories has the power to shape policy around vacant housing. Do we invest in tearing vacant houses down or fixing them up? Can demolition solve Baltimore’s vacant house problem? Can historic preservation?\nA recent Blight as Politics Symposium at the University of Michigan articulated the urgency of questioning narrowly framed, just-so stories of the urban crisis:\n\n“With a few signal exceptions, discussions of ‘blight’ have proceeded in dehistoricized and depoliticized contexts oriented around narrow technical parameters, as if ‘blight’ was an easily defined and objective phenomenon instead of the spatial residue of racism and segregation, deindustrialization, disinvestment, and other fraught dynamics of American urban history.”\n\nBaltimore’s vacant houses – an iconic symbol of the city’s poverty, violence and desolation – first appeared before 1982, before 1968, and before 1950. As early as 1880, the Baltimore City Police Department was trying to monitor and mitigate the problems of vacant houses in the city’s wealthy suburbs. In 1910, observers in Baltimore called vacant houses “a growing evil,” the source of “common alarm.” In 1932, one prominent local architect declared that the rowhouse had no potential for “modern and reasonably attractive” use; Baltimore’s “dying areas” were forced into a “hopeless future competition” with the suburbs.\nThe foundation of Baltimore’s current debate over what to do about vacant houses in Sandtown-Winchester has been laid down over the course of a century or more. The debate is framed by a long history of salvage and demolition, stories about the places we choose to forget, to tear down, and to salvage instead of save. In this way, we can read the history of vacants – how we describe them and what we do about them – as an alternate history of historic preservation itself.\n\nConcerns over population loss and vacant housing in Baltimore date back nearly two centuries. Writing in 1831, publisher Hezekiah Niles reflected on the city’s population loss during the economic crisis of the early 1820s, recalling how “because of the want of employment in those years, [there was a] consequent removal of the people, to the north, south, east and west.” The city had recovered from the severe depression and Niles could then boast that, “There is hardly a house unoccupied, though a very large number was built the last season.”\n\n\n\nBaltimore (1838), George W. Boynton. [JScholarship](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/35332\n\n\nWith capital from men like Hezekiah Niles, as well as the labor from thousands of recent immigrants, enslaved and free blacks, Baltimore grew quickly. The city more than doubled in population between 1830 and 1850. Growth came with new patterns of land use around Baltimore’s downtown. Property-owners tore down hundreds of old homes to make way for new warehouses and commercial buildings.\nIn May 1847, the National Intelligencer on a rare demolition “deemed worthy of notice,” wrote:\n\n“workmen are now engaged tearing down the very oldest house in Baltimore; to erect in its stead an elegant new warehouse. […] Daguerreotype sketches and other drawings were taken of it, to preserve as relics, prior to its demolition.”\n\nIn a later example, from January 1891, locals gathered at the scene of the demolition of a former suburban mansion overwhelmed by the city built up around it with a plan to take more than drawings. As the crowd watched the “quaint but pretentious little building of classic architecture” disappear “before the march of modern improvement” they “eagerly gathered “pieces of its mantel-pieces and bits of its woodwork […] for souvenirs.” The home, known as Tusculum, was fondly remembered as the host of a vibrant arts and poetry society in the early 1800s. Despite the building’s neglect, it was still occupied by a “family of colored people” who “made the noted Tusculum their home” but likely had little power to protest their eviction.\n\n\n\nPhotograph of Tusculum, c. 1891. Maryland Historical Society, [SVF] via MdHS Photographs Tumblr.\n\n\nAfter demolition, the elements of an abandoned building could be turned into mementoes or into the very source of subsistence and survival. The hard times that Hezekiah Niles witnessed in the early 1820s returned again in wake of the Panic of 1893. In February 1895, the Sun reported how:\n\n“The demolition of the Old City College building on North Howard street was eagerly watched all day yesterday by a crowd of persons armed with baskets or bags, and anxious to pick from the ruins some bits of wood to add to their scanty store of fuel at home.”\n\nPerhaps some among the crowd took shelter in the city’s vacant houses. In the 1880s, many impoverished travelers - “tramps” - had been found “sleeping in the brick and limekilns of South and Southwest Baltimore.” A white person with no home could find a place to spend the night at a police station house, but as the Sun observed in 1888:\n\n“A notable fact is the small number of colored tramps who call at the station-houses. This is not because there are no colored tramps, but because they are generally badly treated by their white brethren when lodging together.”\n\nEvidence for the growing availability of vacant houses in the city can be found in an October 1898 account which observed defensively:\n\n“Other cities have endeavored to make capital of reports of the very large number of vacant houses in Baltimore, claiming it as an evidence that this city is falling behind.”\n\nThe account continues to highlight a strong resurgence in home building - but, as the next decade illustrated, strong growth could paradoxically increase vacant housing. This combination of growth and inequality shaped a new response to vacant housing from metal thieves and the city police.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1880, the city’s population doubled again and new buildings had sprawled over the city limits and into “the Belt” - an area built up with factories and clusters of suburban cottages that surrounded the city to the east, west and north. Throughout this period, inadequate sewers and frequent outbreaks of disease encouraged many well-off residents to leave their homes every summer.\n!New and Enlarged Map of Baltimore City: Including Waverly, Hampden, All the Parks, and a Miniature Map of the State (1886), John F. Weishampel. [JScholarship](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/36534).]\nSeasonal vacancy illustrates the challenge of defining what makes a vacant house. Whether a property owner leaves their house unoccupied for a month or a year, when does it become vacant? The persistence and scale of seasonal vacancy between the 1860s and early 1900s, left many homes at risk of an illicit form of salvage and demolition - metal theft - and placed a new burden on Baltimore city and county police officers to protect the Baltimore’s vacant homes on behalf of their absent owners.\nAn typical example of metal theft at a vacant house appeared in March 1868 describing how thieves in the night “carried off, undetected, two chandeliers and six brackets valued at $125” from a vacant dwelling at 659 West Lombard Street. In 1877, the Sun described how a suburban home in northwest Baltimore standing “vacant for some months” was “entered by vandals and despoiled of nearly all its detachable metal fittings,” adding that “Residents of the belt complain that depredations of this kind are frequent.” In 1887, two men were arrested for taking “copper lining in bath-tubs, gas brackets, globes and lead pipe” from “unoccupied houses in the neighborhood of Lexington street and Fulton avenue.”\nThe police response to these threats was creative. In 1877, the officer encouraged property-owners cut “peep-holes” in their back fences “at convenient points for observation, through which the officers can have a full view of the rear of the premises without climbing over.”\nIn August 1881, the police asked local families to report their travel plans to local authorities creating what is likely the city’s earliest formal inventory of vacant buildings, as the Sun reported:\n\n“This summer the exodus from Baltimore has been greater than usual, and there are probably some twelve or thirteen hundred houses vacant, mainly in the north and northwestern sections of the city. The protection of this property is left to the police, and how to preserve it intact has been a matter of careful consideration by the police authorities. Notifications that the families have removed are generally sent to Police Marshal Gray or to the captains of districts with requests that the houses be looked after.”\n\nIn 1897, concern over “Vacant House Robberies” led Baltimore police officers to patrol in “citizen dress” to try to catch thieves in the act. Baltimore Police Captain Solomon Freeburger offered a number of creative ideas as a solution including a plan to place younger officers in the neighborhoods with the greatest number of vacant homes, noting:\n\n“In the residential parts of the city where there are great numbers of vacant houses, it would be well to place the young men who are active and alert. Daily inspection of all property left for the summer is practiced at present in this city.”\n\nFreeburger even recommended electric burglar alarms calling them an “almost a perfect guarantee of a thief’s apprehension, or, at least, that he will be frightened off before accomplishing robbery.”\nMetal theft is one of the earliest local examples of illicit and criminal activity that concentrated on vacant houses but it is far from the last.  In the 1910s and 1920s, police raided illegal stills and gambling halls in vacant houses. In the 1930s, officers made mass arrests of “vagrants,” people left homeless and unemployed by the Great Depression, who took shelter in the growing number of abandoned homes. In this way, vacant houses became more than just unoccupied buildings - they became seen a threat to public order that required an aggressive response by the police and public policy.\n\nContinue reading part two. Featured photograph by Ben Marcin via Slate.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {We Have a Problem with Vacant Houses in {Baltimore.} {Part}\n    One of a Draft Paper for the {VAF} {Conference} in {Chicago.}},\n  date = {2015-05-12},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-05-12-we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-one-of-a-draft-paper-for-the-vaf-conference-in-chicago},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “We Have a Problem with Vacant Houses in\nBaltimore.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This past October, I had the privilege of participating in a panel organized by Dr. Nicole King at the American Studies Association Annual Meeting in Baltimore, along with Ms. Linda Shopes, Dr. Denise Meringolo and Dr. Ed Orser. The theme of the panel – Baltimore City as Laboratory: Transformations of Urban Neighborhoods through Public History Programming – helped frame a discussion on how our work  used “public history programming to address complex issues of identity and social justice in urban space” led by  Linda Shopes, an editor of the influential 1991 The Baltimore Book: New Views of Local History. I wrote the following short piece highlighting our work with the Race and Place in Baltimore Neighborhoods project where I had the chance to work closely with both Linda and Ed on the development of tour programs and a website (still in development).\nOver the past two years with Baltimore Heritage, I’ve worked on a handful of projects connecting historic preservation and neighborhood revitalization in the historic neighborhoods of West Baltimore. West Baltimore is not a likely place for this particular approach. I often encounter questions from both residents – and, perhaps even more often, people who live outside these neighborhoods – asking why bother with preserving or interpreting the history of neighborhoods and communities, whose struggles with abandonment, addiction, disinvestment and violence seem to overwhelm any other concerns? I can’t put this question aside quickly or easily so I’ll continue with this issue unresolved– how can our shared heritage be used to build better neighborhoods and better lives for West Baltimore residents?\nBaltimore Heritage is a nonprofit historic preservation advocacy organization established in 1960. We’re a small group, two and a half staff supported by membership and programs, with a history of energetic preservation advocacy. My own position began in fall of 2009 with support from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, to focus on African American heritage city-wide, matched by grants from the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative which required us to focus these outreach efforts in support transit-oriented community development in an area of West Baltimore neighborhoods proposed for the development of a new light rail route known as the Red Line.\nAlthough West Baltimore is not exceptional within the city, or certainly when compared to neighborhoods in North Philadelphia, the east side of Cleveland, or the South Bronx, in some West Baltimore neighborhoods the scale of vacancy and abandonment is incredible, shocking to visitors and a tragedy for residents who live next door to collapsing rowhouses, burnt-out factories and brownfields. Neighborhoods like Harlem Park, Upton, and Midtown Edmondson can be characterized by concentrated poverty and limited access to fresh food.  Despite these challenges, however, you can find unique historic architecture on almost every block, from pre-Civil War rowhouses to midcentury modern civic and educational buildings. Historic green spaces, like Lafayette Square or Franklin Square, are still well loved and well used by many neighborhood residents.\nAny explanation of this confusing landscape must draw on intersecting histories of racial segregation, housing discrimination, community development and urban renewal. Following these threads can help us connect the beginning of these neighborhoods–developed as affluent, European suburbs in the late 19th century to the emergence of Old West Baltimore as one of a handful of segregated black communities in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. We can continue through the rapid racial transition that transformed whole swaths of West Baltimore from white to black during the 1950s and 1960s (deftly chronicled by Dr. Ed Orser in Blockbusting in Baltimore: The Edmondson Village Story) and the terrible mix of industrial job loss and urban renewal that gutted the heart of West Baltimore neighborhoods in the 1970s and 80s.\n\n\n\nDr. Ed Orser at Lauretta Avenue, Greater Rosemont Walking Tour\n\n\nOur work in West Baltimore been a bit experimental, testing our hypothesis—heritage is an asset for West Baltimore’s community development—by exploring new ways to organize residents and reshape the perception of the historic built environment from a liability into an asset. Our experience so far has led us to a few ideas about what is important and what might work–\n\nWe are dedicated to a usable past that seeks out histories of development, struggle, and organizing that offer tools to better understand contemporary concerns.\nWe embrace difficult stories, recognizing the importance of stories around enslavement, civil rights, racism and urban renewal to shaping the history of these neighborhoods and continuing to engage residents and visitors at a visceral level.\nWe don’t work alone. Our research and interpretation seeks to engage residents and other stakeholders in the interpretation of local history and the development of tours.\n\nRace and Place in Baltimore Neighborhoods was one of our first large scale projects to address these themes of segregation and community development. With support from the Maryland Humanities Council and Free Fall Baltimore, we organized a series of four collaborative programs—a lecture on the local history of public housing and three walking tours in historically African American neighborhoods–Upton, Greater Rosemont, and Sharp Leadenhall–led by scholars from the Reginald F. Lewis Museum, UMBC and Towson University working in collaboration with resident-led neighborhood organizations. Together these programs aimed to stimulate an informed discussion about the historical experiences of residents and institutions in Baltimore’s historically segregated African American communities in relation to contemporary debates on historic preservation and community development.\n These three tours visited a diverse set of historic places, while considering issues from highway fights and anti-gentrification neighborhood organizing in South Baltimore through the flourishing of civil rights activism in churches and businesses in the neighborhoods of Old West Baltimore. We visited Thurgood Marshall’s elementary school. We walked by the only Baltimore dollar house where a black resident displaced by eminent domain during the highway fight successfully returned to his home. In church basements, we discussed topics from the feasibility of rowhouse rehabs to the potential of transit-oriented development in the broader Baltimore region. In a single month, we engaged nearly 250 people, an audience that was notably more diverse in age and race than many of our more conventionally presented tour programs. This project affirmed our confidence in our new strategies for collaboration and interpretation, strategies that we continue to use in the development of new tours and publications focused on themes including the Civil War history of West Baltimore.\nThe results of these explorations remain inconclusive. We’re still testing against the enduring challenges of decades of disinvestment along with our own limited capacity as a small nonprofit. I’m encouraged though by the idea that we’re not along. As we’ve searched for new ideas to apply to our own work, we’ve gotten to know a few of the organizations and individuals wrestling with these same concerns, testing their own approaches in local laboratories across the country. I’ll give you three examples–\n\nAndrew Hurley’s work in St. Louis, documented in his recent book Beyond Preservation: Using Public History to Revitalize Inner Cities, offered historical and archeological research and interpretation to North St. Louis residents and organizations with the goal of supporting grassroots revitalization. Hurley observed, “Inner-city preservationists embarking on such a path can anticipate a  host of difficult decisions as they wrestle with the inevitable tension between community-building and economic-development goals.” - p.31\nCliveden, a 1760s mansion built for Revolutionary-era elite Benjamin Chew, had been a stodgy house museum through the early 2000s when they dedicated themselves to finding new relevance to their diverse, low-income neighborhood of Germantown, Philadelphia. In charting this new course, they decided to abandon the visitor, redefining their mission to serve as “a catalyst for preserving and reusing historic buildings to sustain economic development for historic Northwest Philadelphia and beyond.”\nThe Los Angeles Conservancy, supported by the same National Trust grant program as our work at Baltimore Heritage, hired a new organizer to greatly expand their outreach and advocacy in the segregated Latino communities of East LA, undertaking projects such as “Save Wyvernwood,” where they supported the efforts of a resident community in the 1939 Wyvernwood Garden Apartments to resist displacement and the demolition of their homes.\n\nThese examples are distinct, I know. At the same time, we’re all together wrestling with that same question I posed a few minutes ago. We’re not finding any easy answers but I do think we’re gaining confidence that public history and preservation scholars and professionals are right to ask this question.\nNed Kaufman, a long time director of historic preservation for the Municipal Art Society of New York, offered an answer of sorts in Place, Race, and Story: essays on the past and future of historic preservation, writing–\n\n“History offers a way to establish a presence within the public space of political and cultural discourse–and without presence one can hardly hope for leverage. History can’t provide adequate housing, end discrimination or prevent redevelopment, but it can contribute to the debate that is necessary to achieving these goals.” - p.401\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2011,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Race and {Place} in {Baltimore} {Neighborhoods} at the\n    {American} {Studies} {Association} {Annual} {Meeting}},\n  date = {2011-11-29},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-11-29-race-and-place-in-baltimore-neighborhoods-at-the-american-studies-association-annual-meeting},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2011. “Race and Place in Baltimore Neighborhoods at\nthe American Studies Association Annual Meeting.” November 29,\n2011. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-11-29-race-and-place-in-baltimore-neighborhoods-at-the-american-studies-association-annual-meeting."

    "text": "I wrote this post back in January as a proposal for THATCamp Columbus.\nHow do scholars, activists, tourists, neighbors, city planners, and preservationists find and share information about historic places in their communities, in their cities, and in their regions? How do they identify relationships between places or understand the context within such places were constructed, occupied, or even destroyed? In most cases, anyone interested in these questions might rely on a wide range of tools and resources, such as calling a local historical society, finding a walking tour brochure at a local visitor center, visting the local history section of the neighborhood library, searching a web-based database provided by a State Historic Preservation Office, or simply searching online in the hope that someone might have already investigated the location. The latter is often productive but resources are currently fragmented both topically and geographically, as well as suffering from an absence of essential features such as mapping, sorting or filtering. If you are searching for information on historic theaters Cinema Treasures is indispensable, roadside architecture can be found at RoadsideArchitecture.com, the Labelscar retail history blog has documented hundreds of shopping malls but none of these sites allow the consideration of the unusual buildings within their local contexts. For example, what African-American neighborhood did the Comet Theater serve? What was located at the site of the Westland Mall prior to  its construction in 1969?\nIn addition, while a few websites offer a rich user experience, the web services provided by State Historic Preservation Offices are often severely limited by accident or by design (as some local and state governments license their data on historic places to private contracts if they maintain an updated database at all). Take a look at the National Register database provided by the Maryland Historical Trust or the basic PDF list provided by Virignia to get a sense of the limited services provided by government institutions in this regard. Even more effective examples, such as the Pennsylvania Historical Markers website or the National Register NPS Focus database, are often closed and provide few opportunities to even make comments, let alone access the underlying database for mashups or analysis. Regrettably, few preservation organizations even at a state or municipal level, let alone small museums, nonprofit preservation advocacy organizations, neighborhood and city historical societies, have sufficient technical expertise or capacity within their organizations to build and maintain new and effective web applications.\nEven with the issues I’ve identified with both independent and publicly supported websites sharing data on historic places, the most serious issue is the great extent to which our knowledge of historic places is limited to the minds of a few individuals in our communities, in a box of documents sitting in a damp basement, or a drawer full of unlabeled photos at a neighborhood church. I’m curious to explore the potential of building websites that support sharing our knowledge of historic places, capturing new knowledge from those who hold it, and allowing scholars, activists, and interested citizens to explore this data at local, regional and national scales. Possible models for this approach may lie with smaller projects such as the Philadelphia Architects and Buildings Database, the North Carolina Architects & Builders project, the University of Berkley’s California’s Living New Deal project, Teaching + Learning Cleveland, the Community Almanac from The Open Planning Project, the Open Plaques website, and dozens of others.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2010,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {How Do We Share Our Knowledge of Historic~Places?},\n  date = {2010-08-11},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-11-how-do-we-share-our-knowledge-of-historic-places},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2010. “How Do We Share Our Knowledge of\nHistoric Places?” August 11, 2010. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2010-08-11-how-do-we-share-our-knowledge-of-historic-places."

    "text": "A few months back, I stumbled across a whole series of posts from 2008-2009 that Baltimore designer and educator Fred Scharmen wrote for a project he called the Middle Branch Case Studies. For folks outside of Baltimore, the Middle Branch is a shallow estuary of the Patapsco near the Baltimore City line. Fred’s mix of informal ethnographic reflection and thoughtful research make great reading for anyone interested in a few of Baltimore’s more marginal landscapes.\n\n\n\nDSC02200a\n\n\nRighthand Rule: South Baltimore No-Go Zones Part 1: Swann Park\n\nAfter walking through the open gate of a closed park, along a path through a broken fence, to the edge of a crumbling bridge that leads to a shuttered power plant, you realize there’s always another layer. The No-Go zones are nested like Russian dolls, but there’s no deterrent quite as powerful as the feeling that you’re being watched. I’ll come back when there’re no boats.\n\nMiddle Branch Case Files: Reed Bird Island Park\n\nNow Reed Bird Island is technically a city park, but only, as my collaborator Eric and I found out, because of a suggestion made by the Olmsted brothers (sons of Frederick Law) in 1904. They pointed out that erosion from development upstream at the Patapsco River was leading to the accumulation of mud flats here at the river’s mouth. These were being occupied and used for dumping.\nThe Olmsteds, as part of their 1904 report on potential park spaces in Baltimore, suggested that the city get ahold of these islands, (their status was in doubt because they were basically new, free land) and cap them to form parks. They also pointed out that rerouting the new bridge to cross these things would increase their visibility and connection to the city. So after a few years, that’s what happened.\n\nSoft Sites: Masonville Cove\n\nThe Claw is conspicuous, jumping out of the gmaps aerial photo like a mutant appendage. Between the double pressures of development and industry, this much feral openspace on the waterfront is an anomaly, even for the spottily derelict Middle Branch. It is heavily vegetated, but walking the site, feeling the mossy bricks, ceramic powerline insulators and huge concrete blocks underfoot, one sees that this is really just a big pile, a ground made of stuff.\n\nPort Covington: The Ghost of the Masterplan in Tinkerer’s Paradise\n\nThen, as now, the spaces on the ground between these lines of connection and transfer were largely forgotten and undeveloped. In the 19th century, this area was the backyard and back door to the city of Baltimore, and like any backyard, this was a place for recreation and storage, comingled with trash and half-completed projects. The map above, part of a citywide topographic survey from 1895, shows rowing piers and resorts among the marshes, along with a dog pound, a guano pier, and a “night soil dump”.\n\n\n\n\nDSC02325\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2011,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {Reading the {Middle} {Branch} {Case} {Studies}},\n  date = {2011-12-06},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-12-06-reading-the-middle-branch-case-studies},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2011. “Reading the Middle Branch Case\nStudies.” December 6, 2011. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2011-12-06-reading-the-middle-branch-case-studies."

The Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Authority demolished scores of 19th century rows and mansions to clear the way for development but developers only completed a handful of the many proposed building projects.\n\n\n\nMap courtesy University of Baltimore Langsdale Library Special Collections, BURHA, Series X.

    "text": ".](images/aptopix-suspect-dead-baltimore-1880x1197.jpeg)\n\nOn August 14, 1957, the Baltimore Sun published an editorial inspired by the proposal to locate a new Civic Center in Druid Hill Park despite strong objections by the Baltimore Park Board. More broadly, the piece highlights some of the consequential choices that Baltimore made in the 1940s and 1950s when they traded parkland for police stations and highways. This is, in part, the story of how the Western District Police Station replaced a playground at Mount Street and Riggs Avenue.\n\n“Under the city charter the Park Board has”charge and control” of all park property. A guardian for the park system, with the power to say “no,” is needed because proposals to encroach on park property are being made all the time. Sometimes public interest justifies the proposals. Sometimes it does not. The Park Board is there to make such determinations, always with the welfare of the parks in mind.\nWe offer a few examples, just to show the kind of pressure the park system is under:\nThe State wanted 21 acres of undeveloped land in Herring Run Park in connection with plans for the Northeast expressway and the approach to the Harbor Tunnel. The Park Board went along with this.\nThis had the effect of cutting off 50 other acres of Herring Run Park. The city asked for these acres for a site for a new wholesale market. The Park Board went along. Total loss to Herring Run: 71 acres.\nIn planning an extension of Perring parkway, the city wanted 5 acres of the Mount Pleasant golf course. The Park Board was able to acquire some partially compensating acreage and went along.\nThe city concluded that a playground at Fulton and Riggs avenues, for which the Park Board planned further development, would be the ideal site for a new police station. The Park Board was finally convinced, and co-operated.\nThe city also wanted an acre of land, near Hurley and Fonthill avenues, for another police station. This was park of Gwynns Falls Park, but the Park Board, finding it not particularly desirable for park purposes ,went along.\nPark land along Mount Royal terrace was plainly needed for the Jones Falls expressway. The board yielded the land after a scheme had been worked out which gives compensating advantages in return for the lost land.\nSome time back, to relieve traffic congestion, the city proposed extensions of McCulloh street and Druid Hill avenue to drive through the southwest corner of Druid Hill Park. The Park Board acquiesced in this plea of necessity, after standing up for a minimum of impairment.\nAt one stage in the civic-center proceedings, a site in Clifton Park was proposed. Northing came of this.\nAt another stage in the same proceedings, a proposal was made to take over the small park adjacent to the Mount Royal Station. Nothing came of this.\nThese are merely a few of the more conspicuous episodes in what might be called a continuous war of attrition against the parks. They point up the necessity for a semi-autonomous body with power to pass judgment on all schemes for reducing out precious park acreage.\nBut now the authority of this body, the Park Board, has been defied. When the Mayor and City Council seized 30 acres of Druid Hill Park land for a civic center site, they did so against the will of the Park Board. If this seizure stands unchallenged, a shadow lies across the board’s supposed powers. The guardian of our park system will have been disarmed.\n\nSource: “Disarmed.” The Sun (1837-1989).

    "text": "Image courtesy the H. L. Mencken Collection, MDCH, mcms035\n\n\nI was thrilled this morning to discover the April 15, 1939 entry from H.L. Mencken’s diary sharing an account of visiting the modest rowhouse on West Lexington Street where he was born in 1880. Mencken observed the blocks to the north being torn down for the development of the Poe Homes which broke ground later that year on October 11, 1939. New Deal slum clearance history and H.L. Mencken history? This is my lucky day.\n“In going through some old bills I found the other day that the house I was born in was No. 380 W. Lexington street in 1880. I wrote to the Appeal Tax Court asking the present number and was informed that it is now 811. This morning I went down to Lexington street to have a look. I found a pleasant little three-story house, directly opposite a slum area that is being cleared off under the Federal housing scheme. The door of the place was open, and inside I found a colored man on a stepladder and a white man on another. The colored man told me that he was the new owner of the place. He had been living in his own house in the slum area, but the government had now condemned it. He told me that the price he got for it was considerably less than his investment. He had used the money to buy No. 811 and was now engaged in rehabilitating it. He was scraping the accumulated wallpaper off the parlor walls, and the white man, a plasterer, was patching the holes that this work revealed. The colored man seemed to be a very intelligent and decent fellow. He told me that he hoped some day to put in a central heating plant, and I was tempted to offer him the price. I’ll probably go back and see him at some time in the near future.\nFifteen or twenty years ago my mother pointed out the house to me, but after her death I could no longer identify it. It is a three-story building in a sad state of disrepair. When I was born in it West Lexington street was almost suburban. There were trees all along both curbs, and the roadway was hardly more than a country road. The whole neighborhood has been given over to Negroes for many years, and has steadily and rapidly deteriorated. As I have said, the block opposite has been condemned as one of the worst slums in Baltimore, and is to be pulled down and rebuilt. This condemnation apparently took no account of the fact that the colored man now renovating No. 811 owned his own house and made diligent efforts to keep it in repair. In even the worst slum areas there are plenty of such men. All the older streets of Baltimore show their thrift and industry. Unfortunately, their neighbors have deteriorated so vastly that their houses become almost uninhabitable. This poor man not only got an insufficient price for his own house; he was also compelled to pay an exaggerated price for his new one, for the rebuilding operations across the street will augment its value. He is one of the forgotten men who always suffer when schemes of uplift are afoot.”\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2012,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {H.L. {Mencken} on the “Forgotten Men Who Always Suffer When\n    Schemes of Uplift Are Afoot”},\n  date = {2012-10-19},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2012-10-19-h-l-mencken-on-the-forgotten-men-who-always-suffer-when-schemes-of-uplift-are-afoot},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2012. “H.L.

    "text": "Tusculum, c. 1891. Maryland Historical Society, [SVF] via MdHS Photographs Tumblr\n\n\nI spent a good part of the winter holidays researching the history of vacancy, demolition and salvage in Baltimore. When local builders tore down many of the city’s earliest homes in the decades after the Civil War, it is likely that laborers salvaged bricks and metal for reuse or resale. The January 1891 demolition of Tusculum, however, stood out as an early example of salvage for sentiment rather than simple material utility:\n\n“‘Gwynn’s Folly,’ the quaint but pretentious little building of classic architecture which stood for years in Bank lane, between St. Paul and Calvert streets, has disappeared before the march of modern improvement, and nothing now marks the spot where it stood but a pile of rubbish and the five stately elms that for nearly a century had guarded it… The ancient edifice had a warm place in the hearts of many a white-haired Baltimoreans, and pieces of its mantel-pieces and bits of its woodwork were eagerly gathered up for souvenirs… About 1830 the improvements of the neighborhood shut in and hid the ‘Tusculum’ and converted Bank lane into an alley… For a number of years past a family of colored people have made the noted Tusculum their home.”\n\nWilliam Gwynn, newspaper owner and editor, commissioned architect Robert Carey Long to design and build Tusculum around 1820. Gwynn hosted meetings of a group that became known as the Delphian Club up through the 1830s. Carleton Jones described a typical scene in a 1991 article:\n\n“On the right night, visitors to Tusculum’s part of town (just northwest of Calvert and Baltimore streets) can hear sounds of revelry within the mansion. Inside, you are likely to find an all-male gang of revelers that makes up the closest Baltimore ever came to having a literary club in the style of new and old England. Gwynn brings them together around the tobacco canisters and the punch bowls and they are hoisting toasts merrily here and there. For a time, they even run their own literary journal.\nIn the crowd occasionally is Harvard College luminary Jared Sparks, who had come to Baltimore to be ordained at the famous Unitarian service where William Ellery Channing would define Unitarian faith. Also among Tusculum habitues are two men destined to write the verses to two of the most immortal clinkers of 19th century sentimental song: Sam Woodworth (“The Old Oaken Bucket”) and John Howard Payne (“Home, Sweet Home”).\nGwynn’s perennial guests dubbed themselves the Delphian Club, and luminaries of the day flocked to get in the act – legal giant William Wirt, who trained eminent men; attorney William Pinckney, whose practice dominated many Supreme Court cases of the day; John Pendleton Kennedy, author of the novel “Swallow Barn,” and often characterized as the James Fenimore Cooper of Maryland; and John Neal, who created the nation’s first nationally important sporting magazine.”\n\n\nSources: “A Noted Old Dwelling Torn Down,” The Sun (1837-1988), January 27, 1891; “Remembering A Literary Lane,” Baltimore Sun, February 10, 1991, Carleton Jones.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {After the Demolition of {Tusculum} in 1891 “Bits of Its\n    Woodwork Were Eagerly Gathered up for Souvenirs”},\n  date = {2015-01-01},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-01-01-after-the-demolition-of-tusculum-in-1891-bits-of-its-woodwork-were-eagerly-gathered-up-for-souvenirs},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “After the Demolition of Tusculum in 1891\n‘Bits of Its Woodwork Were Eagerly Gathered up for\nSouvenirs’.” January 1, 2015. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-01-01-after-the-demolition-of-tusculum-in-1891-bits-of-its-woodwork-were-eagerly-gathered-up-for-souvenirs."

    "text": "As Baltimore begins a review of the city’s Confederate monuments, I’ve been doing some research on the history of these monuments trying to understand the city in which the monuments were originally erected. I was excited to find a “sensible letter” from Charles T. Crane to then Baltimore Mayor Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe, published on March 27, 1880. I was surprised to find that Crane, a Confederate veteran, strongly disavowed the principle behind the recent rebellion and efforts to memorialize the Confederacy, writing: “I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea.”\nWho supported the effort to erect this Confederate memorial? What moved Crane to write to the mayor? How can we understand this unusual document today?\n\n\n\n“The Ragged Gray Jacket,” from a menu published by the Society Of The Army & Navy Of The Confederate States, Carrollton Hotel, Baltimore, January 20, 1896. New York Public Library.\n\n\nOn January 19, 1880, at the annual meeting of the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States in Maryland, a group of Confederate veterans passed a series of resolutions organizing a committee to “secure funds for the purpose of erecting a monument in the city of Baltimore to the memory of Marylanders who died in the service of the Confederate States.” The group worked quickly and, on March 24, the first branch of the Baltimore City Council passed a resolution permitting the Society to “erect a monument on Eutaw Place, near Lanvale st.” Three days later, Crane’s letter appeared in The Sun.\n\n\nIn connection with the subject of a proposed Confederate monument in one of the public squares of Baltimore, Mr. Charles T. Crane, a soldier of the late Confederate army, has written the following sensible letter to Mayor Latrobe, which, it will be seen, is in accord with the views of The Sun, as given yesterday:\n“Hon. F.C. Latrobe.—My Dear Sir. I do not believe that any one who knows me will question my devotion to the cause of the late Confederate States of America. It is with this belief that I venture to address you in opposition to the proposed Confederate monument in this city. I consider the erection of such a monument in the streets of Baltimore impolitic, inexpedient, and injudicious in the highest degree. Whatever the sentiments and sympathies of the people of Maryland may have been or may be now, there was and there is a very respectable minority of them who did not sympathize with the South during the civil war. Whatever may have been the agencies employed to accomplish such result, the fact remains that Maryland did not leave the Union, and while hundreds of her sons gave up their lives in defense of the South, the State itself was never a member of the Confederacy. I yield to no one in honoring the memories of those noble spirits who devotion to principle led them to abandon friends and home to die for what they conceived to be right.\nWe have two beautiful monuments erected to their memories in that hallowed city of the dead –Loudon Park. In my humble judgement this and kindred spots are the only fitting places on Maryland soil for the erection of Confederate monuments, because, whatever it may cost us to make the acknowledgement, however painful it may be to realize the fact, the truth is undeniable that the cause for which they fought is dead. The principles of civil liberty, of State’s rights and of local self-government may live, nay, do live and burn in thousands of manly bosoms, but the cause, a separate national existence for the States and people of the South is _dead—__forever dead_.\nThis being my belief, I, for one, am prepared to accept the situation, and without the least abandonment of principle, without sacrifice of honor, with a heart full of love and reverence for my fallen comrades, I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea, but which will be a standing menace, and a source of bitterness not only to a great number of the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland, but to a great number of the people of the United States. The war is over. For God’s sake let us of the South do nothing to revive its enmities and hates, but rather cultivate a spirit of reconciliation and peace. We are one people, let us be one in spirit as well as in name.\nI know that these views are opposed to some of my nearest and dearest friends, some of whom may be disposed to judge harshly my attitude in this matter. For this I am prepared. I believe I am right, and what is thought of me is of small consequence compared to the evils which I believe will follow the erection of the proposed monument.\nI am, dear sir, yours very truly,\nChas. T. Crane\nBaltimore, March 26, 1880.\n\n\nJust days after the letter was published, the issue arrived before the Second Branch of the Baltimore City Council. Dr. J. Pembroke Thom, a member of the Council and also a Confederate veteran, opposed the proposed monument and presented into the record a memorial (meaning a letter, a memo) of “residents on Eutaw Square and vicinity and elsewhere, against allowing the erection of a Confederate monument on the square.” The letter from local residents, “expressed respect from the memory of the gallant dead, but opposed the movement as calculated to disturb harmony and good feeling between citizens of all shades of opinion.” In addition, the Council received printed memorials “with several hundred signatures of officers and soldiers who served in the Union army and others, in opposition to allowing the erection of the proposed Confederate monument in Eutaw Square.”\nDespite this opposition, on March 31, 1880, the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States in Maryland succeeded in pushing the second branch of the Baltimore City Council to approve the resolution and send it along to Mayor Latrobe.\n\n\n\nGen. Ferdinand C. Latrobe via Captain James\n\n\nOn April 5, 1880, the Mayor returned the resolution to the first branch of the City Council - “without his approval” - writing:\n\n“During the late civil war the people of Baltimore were divided in sentiment and action on the questions which, after a prolonged and embittered struggle, were finally decided by the sword. The ardor, bravery and devotion to principle of the Maryland soldiers, and the honor due to the memory of those who fell upon the battle-field is universally acknowledged. But while the issues involved in the war have been settled by its result, in most cases the convictions of those who as actors or sympathizers took part in the contest continue to exist. Under these circumstances the erection at this time in one of the public squares of a memorial monument commemorative of the acts of those who fought upon either side would not fail to be repugnant to the opinions and sentiments of very many people. The public highways and squares of the city are the common property of all, and we who are temporarily entrusted with their control, whatever our personal opinions may be, are not, in my judgment, justified in dedicating any portion of them to a purpose which would be in direct opposition to the sensibilities and wishes of large numbers of citizens.”\n\nThe effort to build a monument on Eutaw Street evidently ended with Mayor Latrobe’s veto but Confederate veteran groups in Baltimore persisted.\n\n\n\nEutaw Place, c. 1903. Library of Congress, 4a10716v\n\n\nSeven years later, the city saw the erection of a statue honoring Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney (donated by William Walters) in the north square of Mount Vernon Place. In February 1903, the “Spirit of the Confederacy” was dedicated at Mount Royal Terrace. In 1917, the Confederate Women’s Monument was erected at Charles Street and University Parkway. In 1948, the Robert E. Lee-Stonewall Jackson Monument was dedicated on Wyman Park Drive across from the Baltimore Museum of Art. For over 70 years, this persistent commemorative agenda closely paralleled efforts to segregate, disenfranchise, and discriminate against African-Americans in Baltimore and Maryland.\n\n\n\nMt. Royal Ave. and Confederate Monument, 1910. Library of Congress, 4a24916v.\n\n\nIt is striking that even opponents of the 1880 effort — Charles T. Crane, Dr. J. Pembroke Thom, and Ferdinand Latrobe — presented the Civil War as “settled.” They gave little consideration for how the nearly 54,000 African-Americans living in Baltimore at the time may have viewed the memorial. To understand the difficult history and significance of these monuments today, we must continue to expand this story beyond Crane’s letter. We must listen to the voices of the black Baltimoreans who stood witness to the erection of Confederate memorials in 1887, 1903, 1917, and 1948, and have experienced the consequences of these symbols in the city’s landscape up through the present.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{pousson2015,\n  author = {Pousson, Eli},\n  title = {“{I} Am Unwilling to See Erected in the Public Streets of\n    This City a Monument to a Dead Idea”},\n  date = {2015-07-04},\n  url = {https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-07-04-i-am-unwilling-to-see-erected-in-the-public-streets-of-this-city-a-monument-to-a-dead-idea},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nPousson, Eli. 2015. “‘I Am Unwilling to See Erected in the\nPublic Streets of This City a Monument to a Dead Idea’.”\nJuly 4, 2015. https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-07-04-i-am-unwilling-to-see-erected-in-the-public-streets-of-this-city-a-monument-to-a-dead-idea."

I am a planner and program coordinator with the Baltimore City Department of Planning, a former non-profit worker at Baltimore Heritage and the Neighborhood Design Center, a teacher for the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) GIS Certificate Program, and local historian in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSince 2020, I’ve been an enthusiastic R package developer. I’ve created several R packages for mapping and analyzing data related to Baltimore City and Maryland:\n\nmapbaltimore\nbcpss\nmapmaryland\n\nI’ve also created (or made big contributions) to a few packages for working with spatial data or accessing useful APIs:\n\nsfext\ngetdata\nesri2f\ncrashapi\n\nIn 2020, I completed Master’s of Public Health degree at Johns Hopkins University as a Fellow with the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health Bloomberg American Health Initiative. My work during the program included completed an analysis of 311 requests for basement sewage backups in Baltimore and advocacy for the creation of Baltimore’s Slow Streets program in early 2020.\nHere are a few projects from my prior work at Baltimore Heritage:\n\nExplore Baltimore Heritage\nBaltimore’s Civil Rights Landmarks"
