    "contents": "\nThe Enoch Pratt Free Library—Baltimore’s public library system—recently reopened for in-person browsing for the first time in nearly a year. This past Sunday, I visited the Enoch Pratt’s Clifton branch for the first time and I really enjoyed the novelty of exploring a new library after so many months away from any library at all. My ten-year-old daughter shared my excitement so we started talking about the idea of visiting every public library in the city this spring and summer.\nChild giving two thumbs-up standing in front of a brick branch library building.When we made it back home, I decided to make a simple map we could use to keep track of the libraries as we go. We usually ride our bikes when we visit the library so I also wanted to show the distance between each library and our neighborhood. The map is simple but I’m happy with how it turned out so I wanted to write up the approach. It shows off a few ways to handle label placement but I’m really hoping it might entice a few neighbors into visiting a few more libraries this spring as well.\nTo start, I loaded ggplot2 and dplyr packages, and my own mapbaltimore package. I’m also using a couple functions from sf, purrr, and stringr.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(mapbaltimore)\n\n\n\nNext, I pulled in the boundary of the Harwood neighborhood where I live, found the center of the neighborhood using the st_centroid function, and applied a buffer ranging from one to six miles. Including the approximate mileage is especially helpful since I’m hoping we can bike to most (if not all) of these libraries before the summer heat sets in.\n\n\n# Get center of area\narea <- get_area(\"neighborhood\", \"Harwood\")\ncenter <- sf::st_centroid(area)\n\n# Define buffers ranging from 1 to 6 miles\nmiles <- seq(6)\n# Convert miles to meters\nmeters <- miles * 1609.344\n\narea_dist <- purrr::map_dfr(\n  meters,\n  ~ buffer_area(center, dist = .x)\n  )\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, if I try to label the buffered areas it doesn’t work very well. All of the labels overlap at the center of the area.\n\n\ntheme_set(theme_void() + theme(plot.margin = margin(0)))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = area) +\n  geom_sf(data = area_dist, fill = NA, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_sf_text(data = bind_cols(area_dist, dist = miles), aes(label = dist))\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid this issue, I can use the clip_area function from mapbaltimore to return a five meter edge along the left side of each of the buffered areas.\n\n\n# Clip buffered areas\narea_label <- purrr::map_dfr(\n  meters,\n  ~ buffer_area(center, dist = .x) %>%\n    clip_area(clip = \"right\", edge_dist = 5) %>% \n    bind_cols(label = paste0(.x / 1609.344, \" mi\"))\n  )\n\n\n\nWe can take a quick look at how these elements come together. I set the already set theme to theme_void() but I updated the defaults for geom_text, created a background layer (layer_city) that combines the detailed physical boundary of the city (baltimore_city_detailed) with the simple administrative boundary (baltimore_city), and created layers for the buffered areas and labels.\n\n\n# Set family and size for text labels\nupdate_geom_defaults(\"text\", list(family = \"Roboto Condensed\", size = 4))\n\nlayer_city <- list(\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city_detailed, fill = NA, color = \"gray80\"),\n  geom_sf(data = baltimore_city, fill = NA, color = \"gray60\")\n)\n\nlayer_dist <- geom_sf(data = area_dist, fill = NA, color = \"gray70\", linetype = \"dotted\")\n\nlayer_label <- geom_sf_text(data = area_label, aes(label = label), color = \"gray20\")\n\nggplot() +\n  layer_city +\n  geom_sf(data = area) +\n  layer_dist +\n  layer_label\n\n\n\n\nFor the next step, we need the locations for the libraries. Open Baltimore provides access to a GeoJSON file with the location of the Central Library and all of the branches which I can quickly import using the read_sf function.\n\n\nlibraries_path <- \"https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1ae34d0496b04c9faa417a8073b8bb2f_0.geojson\"\n\nlibraries <- sf::read_sf(libraries_path) %>% \n  sf::st_transform(2804)\n\n\n\nIt looks fine but the label placement is a bit tricky—especially in the city’s dense southeast Baltimore neighborhoods there are a few libraries very close together.\n\n\nlibraries %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  layer_city +\n  geom_sf() +\n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = name), nudge_y = 550) +\n  geom_sf(data = area)\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid these overlapping labels and try out a more distinctive style, I decided to divide up the libraries into three groups—libraries in east and northeast Baltimore (mostly), libraries in north and northwest Baltimore (mostly), and libraries everywhere else.\n\n\nlibraries_e <- libraries %>% \n  filter(name %in% c(\"Southeast Anchor\", \"Canton\", \"Herring Run\", \"Hamilton\", \"Northwood\", \"Clifton\", \"Govans\"))\n\nlibraries_nw <- libraries %>% \n  filter(name %in% c(\"Central\", \"Waverly\", \"Forest Park\", \"Reisterstown\", \"Orleans\", \"Roland Park\", \"Hampden\", \"Walbrook\"))\n\nlibraries_s <- libraries %>% \n  filter(!(name %in% c(libraries_nw$name, libraries_e$name)))\n\n\n\nI should be clear that figuring out which library belonged in which group took a bit of trial and error. I’m using the hjust parameter to left align the text for libraries in northeast and east Baltimore then right align everything else and I’m using the angle, nudge_x, and nudge_y parameters to push the text to the appropriate side of the diamond shape I used to mark each library location.\n\n\n# Use geom_sf_text to make each group of libraries into a separate layer\nnudge <- 275\n\n# Reduce the text size\nupdate_geom_defaults(\"text\", list(size = 2.75))\n\nlayer_libraries_e <- geom_sf_text(data = libraries_e, aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)), nudge_x = nudge, nudge_y = nudge*-1, angle = -45, hjust = 0)\n\nlayer_libraries_nw <- geom_sf_text(data = libraries_nw, aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)), nudge_x = nudge*-1, nudge_y = nudge, angle = -45, hjust = 1) \n\nlayer_libraries_s <- geom_sf_text(data = libraries_s, aes(label = stringr::str_to_upper(name)), nudge_x = nudge*-1, nudge_y = nudge*-1, angle = 45, hjust = 1) \n\nggplot() +\n  # Add labels\n  layer_city +\n  layer_dist +\n  layer_libraries_e +\n  layer_libraries_nw +\n  layer_libraries_s +\n  geom_sf(data = libraries, shape = 5, size = 4)\n\n\n\n\nI exported the finished map with ggsave, printed it out, and checked off the two libraries we’ve visited so far. This morning, my daughter circled one more. She had mentioned our new map to her math teacher and, after her teacher told her which branch she usually uses and gave it a good review, my daughter started making a plan for us to visit this weekend. I can’t wait.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nA simple table of photos with a corresponding photo key map is a common type of figure for many different planning documents and reports. Typically, making this type of map can be a bit tedious: pulling a base map into Adobe Illustrator (or another graphics editor), marking the location of each photo on the map, and hoping you don’t get anything mixed up.\nThis post illustrates a reproducible process for making this style of map using R. Using the coordinates embedded in the photo metadata, you can make a map and then combine the map with an table showing each photo alongside a short description pulled from the embedded title or description. At the end, I show how you can use the same approach using photos from Flickr.\nCheck your photo metadata at the start\nGet started by checking the location metadata attached to your photographs. By default, every photo you take with your cell phone saves your location when you took the photo to the Exif metadata attached to the image file. The accuracy of coordinates attached to photographs varies but you can you can check and update the location associated with the photograph using the OSX Photos app or a dedicated utility like GeoTag for OSX or GeoSetter for Windows.\nI also used the Photos app to add a brief description to each image (as the title for each photo). You could also add titles or modify coordinates for one or more images after importing the image exif metadata by modifying the data frame.\nRead the Exif metadata from photos with exiftoolr\nOnce you have a folder of photos with locations and descriptions, you want to use the exiftoolr package to import the image metadata. Josh OBrien describes this package as a wrapper around ExifTool “a comprehensive open source utility for reading, writing and editing meta information in a wide variety of files.” You can use the exiftoolr::install_exiftool function to install ExifTool (if you don’t have it installed already).\nFor this example, I am using five photographs of Baltimore’s Ellwood Park neighborhood. I added titles to each image in the Photos app then exported them to the jpg subfolder I created in the image folder for this post. The following code shows how to use purrr::map_dfr to import selected metadata for each image, sort the images by longitude, and then number the images in order.\n\n\nexif_table <-\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n  fs::dir_ls(path = \"images\", glob = \"*.jpg\"),\n  ~ exiftoolr::exif_read(\n    .x,\n    tags = c(\n      \"SourceFile\",\n      \"DateCreated\",\n      \"Title\",\n      \"GPSImgDirection\",\n      \"GPSLatitude\",\n      \"GPSLongitude\"\n    )\n  )\n) %>% \n  # Rename variables\n  rename(\n    title = Title,\n    latitude = GPSLatitude,\n    longitude = GPSLongitude,\n    direction = GPSImgDirection,\n    date = DateCreated,\n    photo = SourceFile\n  ) %>%\n  # Sort by longitude\n  arrange(longitude) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Number the images\n    number = row_number(),\n    # Remove city, state and zipcode from image title\n    title = stringr::str_remove(\n      title,\n      \",[:space:]Baltimore,[:space:]MD[:space:]212([:digit:]+)\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\nMake a photo table with gt\nNow that we have the metadata for all of the images in a data frame, I can use gt to display the images and descriptions in a simple HTML table.\ngt currently supports image columns created using local images, web images, or images created with ggplot. The example for the local_image helper function in the gt documentation is a bit unclear but I found a helpful example from a user on Stackoverflow that I adapted below.\n\n\n# iPhone photos default to a 4:3 aspect ratio\nimage_height <- 240\nimage_width <- 320\n\nimage_table <-\n  exif_table %>%\n  select(title, number, photo) %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  # Label columns\n  cols_label(\n    title = \"Description\",\n    number = \"#\",\n    photo = \"Photo\"\n  ) %>%\n  # Set photo column width\n  cols_width(\n    vars(photo) ~ px(image_width),\n    vars(number) ~ px(64)\n  ) %>%\n  # Set the font, weight, size, and alignment of the photo numbers\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(\n      font = \"Fira Code\",\n      weight = \"bolder\",\n      size = \"xlarge\",\n      v_align = \"top\",\n      align = \"center\"\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(columns = vars(number))\n  ) %>%\n  # Set vertical alignment for numbers and description\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(\n      align = \"right\",\n      v_align = \"top\",\n      size = \"large\"\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(columns = vars(title))\n  ) %>%\n  # Capitalize column headers\n  opt_all_caps()\n\n\n\nI want the numbers in the table to match the style I plan to use for the key map so I am using the html helper function from gt to stack the number on a FontAwesome circle icon.\n\n\nimage_table <- image_table %>%\n  # Replace file path to the jpg with the image\n  text_transform(\n    locations = cells_body(vars(number)),\n    fn = function(number) {\n      purrr::map(\n        number,\n

The first step to making the map is to convert the data frame containing the image Exif data into a simple features (sf) object and then transform the sf object to use a projected coordinate reference system (CRS).\n\n\nexif_sf <-\n  exif_table %>%\n  # Convert to sf object\n  sf::st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    crs = 4326\n  ) %>% \n  # Convert to projected CRS\n  sf::st_transform(2804)\n\n\n\nI’m transform the data to a projected CRS so I can use the adjust_bbox function from my own mapbaltimore package to define the map area. This function returns a bounding box that contains all of the photo locations with a little extra space (fifty meters) around the edges and a set aspect ratio (4 by 3).\n\n\nmap_area <-\n  mapbaltimore::adjust_bbox(\n    exif_sf,\n    dist = 50,\n    asp = \"4:3\",\n    crs = 3857)\n\n\n\nThe next step is to make the map base layer using the layer_mapbox function from the snapbox package. For this to work, you need to a Mapbox API key to pass to the function or to save it to your local environment with Sys.setenv(MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = \"x\") (substituting your own API key for x). 1\n\n\nimage_map <-\n  ggplot() +\n  # Make satellite map background\n  snapbox::layer_mapbox(\n    area = map_area, # map_area\n    retina = TRUE,\n    map_style = snapbox::mapbox_satellite()\n  ) +\n  inlegend::theme_cropped_map()\n\n\n\nI could have used the buffer parameter built in to snapbox package but it doesn’t currently let you set the aspect ratio for the map area.\nNow I can mark the location of each photograph with the corresponding number on top of the base map. Sorting by latitude or longitude before numbering the images is one easy way to make the number placement predictable.2\n\n\nimage_map_label <- image_map +\n  # Add markers for locations from exif data\n  geom_sf_label(\n    data = exif_sf,\n    aes(label = number),\n    fill = \"yellow\",\n    color = \"darkslategray\",\n    size = 5,\n    label.size = 0.0,\n    label.padding = unit(0.45, \"lines\"),\n    label.r = unit(0.8, \"lines\"),\n    hjust = 0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    family = \"Fira Code SemiBold\"\n  )\n\nimage_map_label\n\n\n\n\nThere are other ways to label the key map. For example, I could use the the exif data again to show where direction I was facing when I took each photo and use the geom_label_repel from the ggrepel package to offset the location of the numbers.\n\n\nhide\n\nimage_map_label_repel <- \n  image_map +\n  # Add the number labels\n  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(\n    data = exif_sf,\n    aes(label = number,\n        geometry = geometry),\n    stat = \"sf_coordinates\",\n    size = 5,\n    fill = \"yellow\",\n    color = \"darkslategray\",\n    label.size = 0.0,\n    label.padding = 0.45,\n    label.r = 0.8,\n    hjust = 0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    family = \"Fira Code SemiBold\",\n    segment.size = 1.35,\n    segment.color = \"yellow\",\n    min.segment.length = 0,\n    nudge_y = 40,\n    direction = \"y\"\n    ) +\n  # Add markers for locations from exif data\n  geom_sf(\n    data = exif_sf,\n    size = 6,\n    color = \"yellow\"\n    ) +\n  geom_sf_text(\n    data = exif_sf,\n    aes(angle = direction * -1),\n    label = \"⬆\",\n    size = 4,\n    hjust = 0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    color = \"darkslategray\",\n    family = \"Fira Code SemiBold\"\n    )\n\nimage_map_label_repel\n\n\n\n\nThe offset numbers could definitely be appropriate if you have image locations clustered too close together but the combined effect with the directional arrows looks too busy. I decided to stick with the simple approach for this example.\nCombine the key map and photo table\nThe last step is to combine the photo table and the key map into a single combined figure. I used the ggplot_image function to insert the image in lieu of a subtitle for the table.\n\n\nimage_table %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Ellwood Park: Photos and Key Map\",\n    subtitle = html(\n      ggplot_image(image_map_label, height = 480)\n    )\n  ) %>%\n  # Set width of table and make\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = 640,\n    heading.title.font.weight = \"bolder\"\n  )\n\n\nhtml {\n

You can save the key to the local environment with Sys.setenv(FLICKR_ACCESS_TOKEN = \"x\") (again substituting your own API key for x). I’m using the getPhotoSearch function to pull images from the Baltimore Heritage Flickr account tagged with the Eager Park, Ellwood Park, or McElderry Park neighborhood names.\n\n\n# remotes::install_github(\"elipousson/FlickrAPI\")\nlibrary(FlickrAPI)\n\nflickr_photos <- getPhotoSearch(\n  api_key = Sys.getenv(\"FLICKR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"),\n  user_id = \"baltimoreheritage\",\n  tags = c(\"mcelderrypark\", \"ellwoodpark\"),\n  extras = c(\"geo\", \"url_m\"))\n\n\n\nNext I convert the data frame of Flickr photos into a sf object. I’m randomly selecting 5 photos from the three neighborhoods making sure only to select landscape oriented images with an associated location.\n\n\nflickr_photos_sf <- flickr_photos %>%\n  # Filter to landscape oriented images with coordinates\n  filter(!is.na(latitude),\n         width_m == 500) %>%\n  # Sample 5 random images\n  sample_n(5) %>%\n  arrange(longitude) %>%\n  mutate(\n    number = row_number(),\n    title = stringr::str_remove(\n      title,\n      \",[:space:]Baltimore,[:space:]MD[:space:]212[:digit:]+\")\n    ) %>%\n  sf::st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n    agr = \"constant\",\n    crs = 4326\n  ) %>%\n  sf::st_transform(2804) %>%\n  select(title, number, photo = url_m)\n\n\n\nFinally, I call the make_flickr_key_table function on the sf object. I didn’t include the Font Awesome icons for the numbers in this version of the table but it still looks good to me.\n\n\nflickr_photos_table <- flickr_photos_sf %>%\n

    "contents": "\nCouncilman Ryan Dorsey first proposed City Council Bill 18-0285 a little over a year ago in late 2018 with the idea to repeal an outdated city law prohibiting ball playing in the street. I started doing some research on the history of the “no ball playing” signs seen in parks and on city streets back in November.\nThankfully, Councilman Dorsey invited me to share my research and testimony last week in support of his proposal. The council committee voted to move the bill forward with amendments including one to repeal the prohibition of “trick or fancy” bike riding (a legacy of the 1890s era “safety bike” craze) and to change the title to: “Repealing the Prohibition of Fun.”\nIt still needs approval from the full City Council but, I expect it to pass, and then go to Mayor Jack Young sign, veto, or sit on until it goes into effect automatically. I’m happy with my small role in the bill’s progress and hope you enjoy my testimony.\nGood morning.\nIt has been over seventy years since the Sun featured the city’s bans on playing in the street and prohibition against trick riding on a list of “dust-covered laws” and “ancient rules”—two of the many ordinances for which the “need” had “apparently vanished.”1\nThe Sun was right to question these laws way back in 1946 but the reporter may have been a bit confused about the reason. By the 1940s, these laws had been used often to turn children at play into criminals and put the police to work clearing roads for drivers instead of preventing violence or investigating crimes.\nCritics of Councilman Dorsey’s proposal to change the law could argue that the laws are rarely enforced. But the truth is that these laws have been enforced so often for so long they have helped turn Baltimore into a place where many families are afraid to let their kids play in the street. Children who do are subject to harassment by the police.\nThese critics might come back and say the streets are dangerous—kids should play in parks and on playgrounds. But, as history shows, parks and playgrounds have never been enough. And, if a city doesn’t allow kids to play in the street, are they really welcome anywhere?\nRegardless of our differences, we can all agree these laws are old. The earliest relevant account I could find is from 1848 when John and Jason Hughes got caught playing ball in the street and had to pay a dollar each.2\nThe old law came up more often in the years after the Civil War when baseball clubs popped up on the corners of nearly every American city. By 1872, at least one Baltimorean was fed up with “baseball maniacs” and pleaded with the city for more enforcement of the then little-used ball playing ordinance.3\nAround the turn of the century, this old public safety measure took on a new role: a quick way to kick kids off the streets and make way for drivers in fast-moving cars.\nIn 1898, the Sun reported on the outcry among children and parents after Police Marshal Samuel T. Hamilton issued a “far-reaching order” to “disperse boys who congregate in numbers upon the smoothly paved streets to play.” One concerned mother wrote in to the paper:\n\n“To children play is as essential to a rational development as is food. Take it away and injure them, besides piling up trouble for parents, teachers, and even the police”\n\nOne boy responded:\n\n“Why don’t the police make us get off the earth altogether and be done with it? What’s a fellow going to do with himself, anyway? The police are always kicking about something… Just because we can’t vote and ain’t got any ’fluence, we ain’t got rights.”4\n\nNewly paved streets did become more hazardous as cars and trucks began crowding out bicycles and horse-drawn carts. Advocates for children pushed for off-street playgrounds where young people could avoid the dual dangers of reckless drivers and police harassment. But, they didn’t give up on those kids playing in the street either.\nIn 1910, the Children’s Playground Association of Baltimore formed a “Guild of Play” that organized supervised street play at seven locations around the city. By the summer of 1926, the Playground Athletic League operated playgrounds—including fourteen roped-off “street playgrounds”—all over.5\n“Playground Athletic League” map showing street playgrounds, 1926Of course, some critics even complained about these supervised street playgrounds. One testy 1914 letter complained about the “roller-skate fiends” on his block and questioned the city’s “legal authority” to permit the activity.6 In June 1923, Police Commissioner Charles D. Gaither claimed that the officers were simply “doing their duty” when they arrested three small children, aged ten, eight, and seven, for playing with a rubber ball in the street in front of their own homes. Gaither argued:\nBall playing, kite flying and stone throwing are forbidden by law. This no longer is a village, and if we don’t enforce these laws somebody will be writing letters asking why we don’t keep the children out of the way of automobiles.7\nAt least a few Baltimoreans pointed out that drivers had a responsibility to stay out of the way of children. In October, Mrs. William M. Maloy spoke at a meeting of the Baltimore Safety Council, explaining her view that “Drivers should not only have their automobiles under control at all times but should prepare for any contingency which the thoughtlessness of a child playing in the street might incur.”8\nYou can probably guess how the rest of the story goes. The city’s street playgrounds disappeared in the 1930s. Some neighborhoods had nice parks and safe places to play but many neighborhoods didn’t. In many neighborhoods, kids grew up being chased out of the street by police—among them former Police Commissioner Edward J. Tilghman, who grew up on the 2400 block of Etting Street just above North Avenue.9\nBut, the story doesn’t end there. In the years after World War II, no ball playing in the streets quickly turned into no ball playing in the parks. I’ve found reports of “No Ball Playing” signs going up in Chinquapin Park in 1953, Wyman Park in 1954, and Elmley Playground a few blocks east of Clifton Park (near Edison Highway and Erdman Avenue) in 1960, among many others.10 Recreation centers surely helped with the shortage of play spaces but, as you all know, the number of recreation centers has dropped from over 130 in 1980 to less than 50 today.11\n“Indignant Citizens,” November 1954, SunHow has all this worked out so far? Well, I don’t have the numbers on how many fewer baseballs have broken windows, but it isn’t looking good for kids.\nThe federal government’s official guidelines for physical activity recommend that young people get at least an hour of activity every day. In 2013, three in ten Baltimore high school students reported less than an hour of vigorous physical activity every week.12\nAround one in four of Baltimore’s middle and high school students reported feeling sad or hopeless.13 Physical activity not only can improve physical health—it can also reduce depression and anxiety.\nWhen Project Play Baltimore surveyed 2,000 East Baltimore youth in 2017, more than one in three said they didn’t have or didn’t know of any safe place to play in their neighborhood.14\nWe can do better.\nOver the past few months as a Bloomberg Fellow and Masters of Public Health student, I’ve been excited to work Dr. Keshia Pollack Porter, a leading researcher on play streets around the United States. Her research has found that encouraging street play can build stronger relationships between neighbors and give young people the physical activity they need to grow up whole and healthy.15 Dr. Porter and I are currently working with the Department of Transportation, Bikemore, the Central Baltimore Partnership, the Neighborhood Design Center and others to organize a play streets pilot program this spring.\nChanging this law sends a powerful message to kids and all the people who care about them. Changing this law says Baltimore City wants you to play and grow up healthy.\nRoger S.

    "contents": "\nI had the opportunity to participate in Baltimore Data Day again this year as part of a panel discussion on Open Baltimore, the city’s seven-year-old open data portal. The narrative notes from my presentation are below and should (mostly) match up with my Google Slides.\nThe presentation is based in part on my rough analysis of the Open Baltimore public asset inventory including a look at just the community or custom views of data created by registered Open Baltimore users and the official datasets (excluding derived views like maps or visualization). I used a Twitter search for mentions of @OpenBaltimore to collect examples of past reactions and complaints. And, I also shared my initial findings on Twitter while soliciting feedback from local residents who have used Open Baltimore. I combined this recent history with a closer look at the history of GIS that I compiled into a rough timeline (also available in an open Google Sheet).\nI’m here today because I’m a data nerd and Baltimore City resident who is equally enthusiastic about using, praising, and criticizing Open Baltimore. Like many others, I’m frustrated by all the ways in which Open Baltimore doesn’t work. And I’ll be talking about those frustrations today. But I also want to start by urging everyone to see fixing these problems as a shared responsibility. By listening to one another’s experiences, I think we can make Open Baltimore better and make Baltimore better at the same time.\nSo let’s start with a look at the recent history of people using Open Baltimore.\nThe first data set uploaded to Open Baltimore—a GIS shapefile of building footprints—was added on January 21, 2011. Northeast Baltimore resident Rob Walshe created the first custom view on Open Baltimore just five days later when he created a list of 311 service requests for graffiti removal in the neighborhoods of Hamilton and Gardenville.\nOver seven years have passed and eight hundred people have created accounts on Open Baltimore to create their own custom views of the city’s open data. This group of users include residents in Medfield, Oliver, Violetville, Homeland, and Howard Park. Some use Open Baltimore to learn about their neighborhoods. Others use the data in their work as journalists, educators, organizers, and researchers. While most people only ever create a single custom view, some create multiple views—often on behalf of a community group.\nYou can judge the popularity of Open Baltimore data sets by page views or downloads but I am more interested in the people who are trying to do something with the data beyond just looking at it. So today, we are looking at these users and the data they’re using including:\nvictim-based crimes\n311 customer service requests\nvacant building notices\narrests\nand 911 calls\nTogether, people have created nearly fourteen hundred custom views based on just these five data sets—totalling over seventy percent of the custom views created on Open Baltimore since 2011.\nBut, despite their consistent interest in using the data published on Open Baltimore, resident experiences with the service are a mix of education, empowerment, and aggravation.\nOne Howard Park resident, John Schladen, started using Open Baltimore in November 2012 and started working with his neighbors to document vacant buildings in their neighborhood. In a March 2015 interview with the Baltimore Sun, John noted the importance of data on housing for residents in Howard Park:\n\n“If we can begin to understand our own condition as a community, we’re going to have much more power.”\n\nBetween January 2014 and November 2015, Samantha Armacost created twenty-five custom views on Open Baltimore on behalf of the Medfield Community Assoication. But, in 2015, she grew frustrated after changes in the availability of victim-based crime data undermined her efforts make sense of public safety in her community. She no longer uses the site.\nUnpredictable coverage wasn’t the only concern for residents or researchers. In an August 2014 report Eric Burnstein and Seema Iyer, noted the difficulty of using the “rounded address” (the unit block number and street name) to assign incidents to neighborhoods. As a result, the 2014 publication of BNIA-JFI’s annual “Vital Signs” report “excluded many crime indicators for the first time since its inception.”\nJournalist Danielle Sweeney started using Open Baltimore in August 2015 as part of her reporting for the Baltimore Brew on police responses to property crime. By April 2017, when she turned to Twitter in frustration, writing: “No one ever answers my questions.” Fortunately, Danielle was not disuaded and actually expanded her use of the site in 2017 and 2018.\nWhile Open Baltimore may not be responsible for the errors and inconsistency in the data provided by city agencies, poor communication does little to correct any misconceptions. User comments on 911 call data point out missing and incorrect information without any offiial reponse.\nThe footer of Open Baltimore encourages people to “nominate a dataset” but the published comments highlight the confusion experienced by many individuals using the site. People are looking for data sets that are already available and wondering what happened to data that has disappeared from public view. People report issues with incorrect or missing data. Few comments of any kind have been published lately. No “dataset suggestions” have been marked as “approved” since February 18, 2014. Users submitted 148 suggestions over the first five years of Open Baltimore’s operation. Over the last two and a half years, only twenty-one suggestions have been submitted. Given the lack of response to prior submissions, people could be forgiven for deciding that trying to request new data on Open Baltimore may not be worth the trouble.\nOf course, Open Baltimore isn’t the only source for data and public information from city agencies. And these other sources have their own challenges: confusing interfaces, inaccessible web design, and dated technical infrastructure. You don’t need take my word for it. Please try finding data and information on a few of these sites:\nBaltimore City Health Department Food Facility Inspection Reports database\nThe Department of Planning’s Community Association Directory\nThe database of applications, inspection reports, and other documents from the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City\nBaltimore Housing’s codeMap\nCan you find the information you need using these sites? Do you feel like the information is accurate and up to date? If not, why not? \nAll to often, residents searching for essential public information run into frustrating and disappointing road blocks. Open Budget Baltimore created by the Bureau of the Budget and Management Research is just one revealing example of this problem. The site tells visitors that the “data that powers Open Budget” is “available to you.” But my recent attempt to follow the link data led back to Open Baltimore where I was confronted by a message tell me to go “Back to where you came from.” Is this what it feels like to have your own city gas-lighting you?\nI truly don’t want to spend our time together on a re-visiting past complaints. Instead, I’d like to find a way to bridge the gap between the aspirations and dreams we’ve brought to Open Baltimore and the experiences it offers for people in Baltimore today.\nFor people who believe in the power of data to make the city a better place, you should remember that you are part of a long tradition.\nIn February 1907, Theodore Marburg, founder and president of the Municipal Art Society, gathered “City and State officials, heads of city departments, City Councilmen and leaders of the thought of a great university” for a “round table” and “smoker” in the Hotel Rennert (where the Charles Center parking lot stands today) to listen to “expositions of the advantages and benefits to be derived” from the city’s new Legislative Reference Department headed by Dr. Horace E. Flack. Before a group of twenty-five White men who sat around a table sipping cups of punch and smoking “fragrant cigars” in the hotel’s “cafe clubroom,” Marburg proclaimed:\n\n“In this hour of change, the most thorough investigation into a city problem made today may be out of date tomorrow. The price of intelligent action is constant investigation. …The money value of adequate data on things we are about to do is difficult to measure.”\n\nHotel Rennert, c. 1896. Published by Alfred S. Campbell. Courtesy Library of Congress.The costs of ignorance may be difficult to measure but we’ve lived with them for as long as Baltimore has been around. For people who are frustrated with the state of open data in Baltimore today, you are also part of a long tradition.\nIt shouldn’t be a surprise to learn that the Citizen’s Planning and Housing Association (CPHA), for example, has created one hundred and fifty custom views on Open Baltimore—more than any other single user. CPHA has a long history of advocating for city staff and elected officials to improve the ways they organize and share data about housing, transportation, and countless other issues. In one 1965 editorial that sounds all too familiar, the organization observed:\n\n“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”\n\nCPHA’s advocacy led to the creation of the Department of Housing and Community Development in 1968 and, by the mid-1970s, the creation of the city’s first “Vacant House File”—a collection of punch cards created for use with a mainframe computer. Today, using codeMap, anyone can find answers to at least some of these questions.\nWhat can we take away from this recent history and the much longer history that preceded it? Here are a few ideas for what the staff reponsible for Open Baltimore and everyone who plays a part in opening access to public data online could consider:\nThe limits or quirks of Socrata may be one source of the problems with Open Baltimore. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that it is the only part or even the most important part.\nConsistent location data is key to ensuring inter-operability and ease of reuse by residents and researchers alike.\nOpen Baltimore and all of the city’s online services need to put a higher priority on accessibility and education.\nOpen Baltimore needs meaningful and useful opportunities for feedback that can be used by both city staff and residents.\n\n\n\n",

You can also see the photos and links I’ve been collecting for this project using the hashtag #baltimoredemolition on Twitter and Instagram.\nAbout a week ago, on March 27, 2018, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan held a press conference in front of six boarded-up vacant houses on the 1000 block of N. Stockton Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Built between 1886 and 1896, the two-story houses had been slated for demolition for over a year with funding from Project CORE, a state program created to expand the demolition of vacant buildings in Baltimore City.1 Hogan used the occasion to announce the newest phase of Project CORE: the planned demolition of five hundred more abandoned buildings that Pugh claimed in a joint statement “provide a haven for criminal activity in neighborhoods most at risk.”\n1020–1030 N. Stockton Street, Baltimore, MD 21217. Photograph by Melissa Archer, Project Manager, Maryland Department of Housing & Community Development, 2017 January 12. Flickr (CC BY).In his speech, Hogan described plans to tear down “decaying and dangerous properties in the highest violent crime areas where the most criminal gang activity is occurring,” suggesting that the city had “designated and prioritized” the targeted vacant buildings as “a contributing factor to violent crime in those communities.” He observed that “vacant and blighted structures too often contribute to the sale and use of illegal drugs and other criminal gang activity” but demolition, together with increased support from state police and proposed legislation to doubling the minimum sentence for repeat felonies involving a gun can improve public safety in Sandtown-Winchester. Hogan then got behind the controls of a John Deere 450D excavator and, with help from a contractor, started tearing down those six houses on Stockton Street.\nGovernor Hogan using the excavator to demolish Stockton Street. Office of the Maryland Governor (CC BY)Pugh offered a similar message when she shared a video of the demolition on Twitter, writing: “We are taking them down so that we can build-up our communities. Our citizens and young people deserve this and so much more.” The city’s recently drafted Baltimore Green Network Plan proposed replacing the vacant houses on Stockton Street and nearby blocks with Smithson Park. The city plans to work with neighborhood residents, represented by the Sandtown South Neighborhood Alliance and the Western District Community Relations Council, to find funding, design, and build the new neighborhood park.2 Smithson Park is one of several pilot projects the plan sketched out for west Baltimore neighborhoods Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, Druid Heights, and Upton.\nOnline reactions to the announcement varied. Laura Baile responded to a video of Hogan’s announcement on Twitter: “Great news. Too many junkies hang out in those abandoned Townhomes and Rob people.” Sander Mednick responded to Pugh: “Start boasting when you actually build something useful. Until then this is much ado about nothing… a rat relocation program.”\nProject CORE demolition site (6 rowhouses), 1020–1030 N. Stockton Street, Baltimore, MD 21217. Photograph by Eli Pousson, 2018 April 5. Baltimore Heritage (CC0)The idea that tearing down buildings improves public safety and reduces crime isn’t unique to Baltimore. A handful of recent examples—Detroit, Michigan in 2010, Camden, New Jersey in 2015, and Chicago, Illinois in 2016—illustrate the recent enthusiasm of elected officials for demolition. About eight years ago, on March 23, 2010, Detroit’s mayor Dave Bing made the case for demolition in his first State of the City address:\n\nBlight is more than an eye sore. Abandoned and dilapidated buildings are hot spots for crime and a living reminder of owners who turned a blind eye and neglected their properties.\n\nBy April, the city had started work on the demolition of an initial group of one thousand vacant houses selected by the city’s Police, Fire and Buildings & Safety Engineering departments using 2009 arson and crime statistics.3\nIn 2015, Camden’s mayor Dana Redd spoke at the demolition of 1510 Louis Street making a similar case:\n\nFor many years, we know our residents have battled with blight, crime, and decay… We know safe corridors can really be safe corridors when we remove these vacant properties.4\n\nRedd shared the plan to remove six hundred houses using funding from the city, Community Development Block Grant program, and a public bond issue.5\nIn 2016, Chicago Alderman Carrie Austin stood in front of a demolition site on the 200 block of West 113th Street and explainined how residents asked her to “beg the city to take them down.” She said demolition would strengthen the community:\n\nWe can rid our community of drug-infested buildings, prostitution and every illegal activity that could possibly be in a community. This effort will strengthen this community once and again.6\n\nThis recent surge in connecting demolition to policing and public safety predated the beginning of the national foreclosure crisis in late 2007. Vacant Properties: The True Costs to Communities, an influential 2005 publication by the National Vacant Properties Campaign (established in 2002 by Smart Growth America), sought to help planners and elected officials understand “the many and varied costs that vacant and abandoned properties impose upon communities” by gathering quantitative research on costs associated with city services (nuisance abatement, crime and fire prevention), decreased property values and tax revenues, and costs to resident home-owners. Crime featured prominently in the list of municipal services but report did not offer any estimates of the “monetary cost” before concluding “it is clear that vacant properties burden police departments.”7 As evidence, the report cited the now infamous “broken windows” theory popularized by criminal justice scholar George Kelling and James Q. Wilson in a 1982 article for The Atlantic.\nTwenty years earlier, Wilson and Kelling argued that, “at the community level, disorder and crime are usually inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence.” They presented vacant buildings not only as potential sites for criminal activity but an enticement for law-breaking:\n\nUntended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder and even for people who ordinarily would not dream of doing such things and who probably consider themselves law-abiding.\n\nWhile many now find this argument suspect, it is important to recognize that proponents of aggressive policing are not the only people calling for the demolition of vacant buildings. Baltimore’s Black residents have a long history of seeking relief from the hazards of vacant buildings concentrated in historically segregated Black neighborhoods.8 It is clear that vacant and abandoned housing is a symptom of broader systemic problems—automobile-centered development and racial segregation foremost among them—but the hazards, financial costs, and stigma largely effect people living nearby.9\nPartial collapse of rowhouse front, 629 W. Lafayette Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21217. Photograph by Eli Pousson, 2018 March 6. Baltimore Heritage (CC0)People living near vacant buildings worry over their own safety and the safety of their neighbors. Elected officials and city residents find common ground in beautification—making neighborhoods more attractive place for existing residents and people traveling through—and in public health and safety—keeping neighbors safe from poor housing conditions, violent crime, and addiction.\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Edward V. Woods heard demands for demolition from at least one resident on Friday, June 26, 1992 when he visited the 900 block of E. Biddle Street to meet the family of s three-year-old boy, Andre Antonio Dorsey, killed by a stray bullet two days earlier. Regardless of any planned police response, the boy’s mother, Felicia Dorsey, was ready to leave, saying, “Even if the police do try to do something more in the neighborhood, I’m not planning on even staying around to see it. I’m moving.” On a brief walk around the block, Woods met a twenty-year-old neighbor, Denise Lewis, who offered the commissioner some advice: “tear all these rotten houses down and build the kids a playground.”10\nLewis recognized that demolition alone wasn’t enough. Kids in East Baltimore needed safe, well-maintained recreational spaces. But, even as Woods listened with a sympathetic ear, the city’s budget reflected a different set of priorities. In 1992, the city’s Police Department employed 3,594 people (about twenty percent of the city’s total) compared to 803 people employed at the Department of Recreation and Parks (not even five percent of the city’s total). The police had a program budget of $181,695,068—more than five times the $34,052,350 program budget for recreation and parks.11\nVacant lots on E. Eager Street by Ambrose Kennedy Park, Baltimore, MD 21202. Photograph by Eli Pousson, 2017 May 10. Baltimore Heritage (CC0)Two decades later, around 2013, East Baltimore residents with Re-Build Johnston Square with organizing support from Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) began advocating for modest improvements in the maintenance of Ambrose Kennedy Park just one block south of the home where Dorsey was killed twenty-five years earlier.12 Ultimately, the advocacy led to a 2016 grant application where the Parks & People Foundation received over $400,000 for the improvement and expansion of the park. In 2017, construction began on the park improvements and, in early 2018, the city began tearing down houses on Eager and Valley Streets.13\nWhile the improvements at Ambrose Kennedy Park are sure to improve the lives of Johnston Square residents, policing, not parks, remains the priority for local elected officials. Between 1992 and 2016, the gap in funding between the Baltimore’s police and parks grew nearly three times over.14 The total number of police employees fell slightly to 3,259—but now made up nearly a quarter of the city’s total employees. Recreation and Parks employed 327 people in 2016—a little over two percent of the city’s total.\nThe limited funding for city parks and the planned expansion of parks under the Green Network Plan suggest that paying for maintenance is going to be an ongoing challenge.15 In addition, not every vacant lot is turned into a park or playground. Whether vacant houses are replaced by parks or vacant lots, does demolition really improve public safety? I believe a sincere commitment to improved public safety in Johnston Square, Sandtown-Winchester, and every Baltimore neighborhood requires a different approach.\nStay tuned for a much deeper history of demolition in Baltimore and more background on the academic research related to public safety, demolition, and parks! Thanks for reading.\n\nThese houses are typically known as “alley houses” given the relatively small size of the individual buildings, the characteristic raised basement, and the narrow width of Stockton Street. The Stockton Street block was part of the Phase II review for Project CORE (see the demolition cluster list and photos of the properties for more information).↩︎\nThe proposed boundaries of the new park are Riggs Avenue, N. Carey Street, N. Arlington Street, and Mosher Street. Project CORE grant funding is one potential source of funding for the new park but is not guaranteed.↩︎\nMLIVE, April 2010; MLive; FREEP (Wayback Machine)↩︎\nNJ.com↩︎\nFrom NJ.com: “The first phase of the project will see about 60 unsafe homes in the city’s Whitman Park and Cramer Hill sections torn down. City council last month awarded the contract to Monmouth County-based demolition company Tricon Enterprises, for $949,000. The second part of the project, which is expected to cost about $8 million, will see 598 more abandoned structures go down.”↩︎\nABC7↩︎\nThe report later notes that compared to demolition “Rehabilitation is clearly a better choice. An examination of the St. Paul, Minnesota budget for maintenance and security costs associated with vacant buildings revealed that while demolition saves $4,697, the rehabilitation of a vacant building will save an estimated $7,141 in maintenance costs over a twenty-year period.”↩︎\nThe 2015 case against Scott Wizig is one example.↩︎\nSee Vacant Buildings 101 for more on the systemic causes of vacancy.↩︎\n@State1992; Lewis reportedly lived nearby on Oliver Street.↩︎\nBudget data is from the 1993 Operating Plan report from the Bureau of the Budget and Management Research; See this Google Sheet on employees by department (1992-2016) for additional context.↩︎\nBaltimore Brew↩︎\nBaltimore Sun on the park grant; The Johnston Square demolitions are part of Phase III of the Project CORE demolition.

My presentation is part of a panel, “Erasure in the Urban Vernacular Landscape,” with Susan Garfinkel, David Rotenstein, and Aaron Wunsch.\nI’ve already done some research and writing on demolition for Project CORE (see my posts for Baltimore Heritage on the 2016 and 2017 demolition review process). With this paper, I’m hoping to look closer at the recent history of demolition in Baltimore (from the 1970s through the 2000s), conduct a few interviews with residents and policy-makers, and get a better understanding of the neighborhood and urban politics of demolition. If you’re a Baltimore resident and you are interested in talking about your experiences with demolition, please get in touch by email or on Twitter! I’m also sharing project photos on Instagram using the hashtag #baltimoredemolition. Read on for my abstract and I’ll try to share updates as I put together a draft over the next few months.\nDecades of demands by local residents and policy-makers to “fix up or tear down” vacant rowhouses in Baltimore, Maryland are expanding under Project CORE, a new program created in 2016 to provide millions in new state funding for local demolition priorities. While the program includes grant funding for stabilization and rehabilitation, the main goal is to erase blocks and blocks of the “blighted” mostly vacant rowhouses concentrated in the historically segregated districts of east and west Baltimore.\nDemolition of vacant rowhouses, 1100 block of E. Hoffman Street, Baltimore, MD 21202, 2017 November 21.Tearing down old buildings while following state and federal preservation law and giving legal due process to private property owners, however, is more complicated than elected officials acknowledge when they promise to make the problems of the past disappear. What room do the politics and policy of demolition leave for residents to mourn the loss of a building or neighborhood? How do residents and advocates envision the benefits of demolition?\nDemolition/deconstruction of vacant rowhouses, 1100 block of E.

    "contents": "\nThis post is a slightly revised version of my lunchtime lightning talk at Baltimore Data Day 2017. This script corresponds to my slides. Thanks to Ciara Christian for the opportunity to share my work around vacant housing, trash, and 311 data.\nIntroduction\nHello! My name is Eli Pousson and I work for Baltimore Heritage, a small nonprofit that advocates for historic preservation across the city. I’ll admit I’m a not a statistician or a GIS expert. I’m a professional historian and an amateur data nerd. I also won’t pretend to have any “objectivity” about vacant houses and trash in Harwood. I live in Harwood and I care about what happens in my neighborhood.\nHarwood\nHarwood isn’t the kind of neighborhood most people think about when you say the words “historic preservation.” It isn’t a historic district and our homes are mostly modest two-story rowhouses. But I like to think about preservation as the work of keeping old buildings in use and making old neighborhoods better places for the people who live there.\nHarwood Park\nBecause old buildings aren’t the only places that need a little tender loving care. So, for nearly a year, I’ve been hanging out at Harwood Park on the 400 block of E. 27th Street cleaning up a few times a month. If a clean park helps to create a more stable housing market, even in a small way, that helps old buildings in my neighborhood.\nVacants on E. 27th Street\nAnd old buildings in my neighborhood need help. These vacant houses stand right across the street from the park. Overall, the Greater Charles Village/Barlcay Community Statistical Area has a 5.4% vacancy rate—less than the city average. But, as most Baltimoreans know, you can’t ignore the challenge of unoccupied and neglected buildings that haven’t yet met the city’s requirements to issue an official vacant building notice.\nVacant Buildings 101\nThis past winter, Baltimore Heritage partnered with the Community Law Center to develop a workshop we called Vacant Buildings 101 to teach community residents how to deal with vacant buildings. And the workshop gave me an opportunity to wonder: How can data help people deal with vacant buildings?\nData can help me to look at a vacant house and see more than just an “eyesore.” I can look and see if code enforcement is working for my neighborhood. I can use 311 data to build a case for a vacant building notice. I can learn when fighting for building rehabilitation and reuse makes sense and when stabilization or demolition may be the only option.\n411 E. 27th Street\n400 block of E. 27th StreetOf course, most folks don’t deal with vacant houses as data in a spreadsheet. They deal with vacants one at a time.\n411 E. 27th Street is a single data point: a vacant building notice issued on February 19, 2015. One of thirty-five vacant building notices in Harwood. One of five on this block.\nTrash by the entrance to Harwood Park\nVacant houses are not the only problem on this block. I may not have the money to fix up every old house in Harwood but I can do something about this mess on our our playground. And I can tell you that picking up garbage and using 311 to report illegal dumping is a great way to learn about using and making open data in your neighborhood.\n1965 report from the Citizens Planning & Housing Association\nThe challenge of gathering data and interpreting data on vacants has a long history. In a 1965 report, the Citizens Planning & Housing Association wrote:\n\n“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”\n\nWhere does data come from?\nWhile we have a lot more of this data today, I can say with confidence that many of my neighbors don’t know where to find or how to interpret data on vacants in our neighborhood.\nIn addition, vacant building notices are tied to code enforcement actions. These actions are often triggered by 311 reports and we can expect people from different background to use 311 in different ways. This variation reveals the inherently uneven approach we use to identify and document issues in our neighborhoods.\ncodeMap showing parcels with vacant building notices\nSo let’s take a look at the data available to me and other residents interested in vacants and trash. codeMap is a remarkable resource for giving residents, community advocates, and developers the opportunity to access much of the same data used by city planners and Housing Department to direct code enforcment officers, prioritize recievership cases, and budget funding for demolition and stabilization.\nRS Link database on receivership cases\ncodeMap also links out to a variety of data sources such as the RSLink database used by Baltimore Housing and One House at a Time to track receivership cases from the first filing to the final sale. I don’t think I’d call this “open” data, however. While you can see these records one at a time, everyday users are not able to search the database or create reports.\nCARTO map of receivership auction results\nThe city doesn’t provide bulk access to this data so I decided reached out to One House at a Time directly. They shared their data on recievership auctions for 2015 and 2016 making it possible for us to create this map showing successful and unsucessful auctions across the city. Five houses in Harwood went through receivership in 2015 and 2016 and all five sold.\n“Truck tire” next to 411 E. 27th Street\nBack to E. 27th Street. One of the key lessons here is that just because you have access to information doesn’t mean you see it. Sometimes 311 requests get ignored when an inspector can’t find the problem. With a bright pink arrow pointing to the truck tire, I figured they couldn’t miss it. (I’ve used this same approach with several requests, e.g. a mattress on E. 27th Street. The graphic is made with an app called Skitch.)\n311 data for Harwood on Open Baltimore\nMy 311 service requests are important to me but I know they are just a handful of the never-ending stream of service requests that city agencies recieve throughout the year. For example, in 2016, Harwood alone saw 1,720 requests to the Bureau of Solid Waste.\nCharting 311 data in Google Sheets\nI pulled the 311 data for Harwood from the Open Baltimore data portal into Google Sheets where I could more easily do some basic analysis and share the results with my neighbors. One of the things I learned from this data is that my love for the 311 iPhone app makes me a bit of an outlier. Only a relatively small portion of 311 requests are submitted through the mobile apps. Most of the 311 requests in my neighborhood are submitted by phone.\nWhat happens after you call 311?\nI also really wanted to know what happened to my 311 requests and how they compared to those of my neighbors. This complicated flow diagram (made using RAWGraphs and Vectr) was my first attempt at following requests from submission to outcome – I’d love to see what other people can make of this data.\nHeatmap of Bureau of Solid Waste service requests in Harwood\nI knew we were having problems with dumping at Harwood Park but what about other parts of my neighborhood? I pulled my data from Google Sheets into CARTO, a free web-based GIS mapping tool, to make a heat map for hotspots of illegal dumping. I also solicited feedback from my neighbors on NextDoor. I used the map and feedback from my neighbors to put together a short tour for Terrance Brown from the city’s Department of Public Works.\nHauling concrete debris by hand after repeated 311 requests\nMy tour with DPW came after I had I’d submitted two 311 service requests for a pile of illegally dumped concrete debris on our playground. Both 311 requests were closed after DPW (or their contractors) removed some trash from the area but left the concrete. I emailed DPW for more information and scheduled the tour to discuss the issue. If we just looked at the data, it looks like we were getting good service in Harwood—but we weren’t yet. I decided to try to deal with the problem myself by piling the concerete into my old half-broken-down wheelbarrow and (with a little help from Donald at the Charles Village Community Benefits District) getting into a dumpster for the Mayor’s Spring Clean Up Day. Four large pieces remained up until late May!\nConnecting housing and litter at Whitridge and Greenmount Avenue\nNow I’m working around the corner on the lot at Whitridge and Greenmount Avenue. Strong City Baltimore has identified the poor condition as a barrier to the sale of the rehabbed houses on Whitridge Row. It is also unfortunate for people waiting for the bus on Greenount Avenue. While we can use data to argue for the importance of lot improvements, we can also put on some gloves and make a “data visualization” like this one: showing the amount of garbage one person can pick up on this lot in about fifteen minutes.\nMaking data open\nI’ll wrap up by inviting everyone to try to explore how you can make data more open.\nTry setting up an account on Open Baltimore and creating a filtered view for your neighborhood. (See my tutorial on using Open Baltimore for tips.)\nNext time you make a report: skip the PDF and just share a Google Spreadsheet. (I’ve set up Google Sheets with data on demolition permits and citations for property owners who failed to abate unsafe properties.)\nDon’t just record data, take photos and show your work along the way. (I stay motivated to address litter and dumping issues by sharing photos of litter on Instagram at #riseandpickuplitter)\nDon’t just use data. Be part of making data!\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOur project on Baltimore’s Civil Rights Heritage is supported by the Maryland Historical Trust, the National Park Service, and PNC. This post is a draft of an essay recorded for Humanities Connection on WYPR in 2017.\nIt is easy to forget that the Civil Rights movement did not begin in the basement of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where Martin Luther King, Jr. and others organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. It is easy to forget that the movement did not end in 1968 on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. It is easy to forget but, as Baltimore’s own Frederick Douglass reminded his audience in 1884:\n\n“It is not well to forget the past. Memory was given to man for some wise purpose. The past is the mirror in which we may discern the dim outlines of the future.”\n\nWe’ve kept his words in mind, as Baltimore Heritage and our partners documented the local history of the Civil Rights movement for the National Register of Historic Places. We’re looking at books, letters, and old photographs. But we’re also looking at the churches, homes, parks, and street corners where the history of the movement took place.\nToday, Baltimore remembers Frederick Douglass with statues at Morgan State University and at a waterfront park at the western end of Thames Street. The Aliceanna Street house where Douglass lived before escaping from slavery in 1838 is gone. You can still visit the 500 block of South Dallas Street in Fell’s Point and see a group of rowhouses Douglass built in 1892.\nPeople all around the country remember Douglass’ story. As a historian, I’m always grateful to people who remember.\nMembers of Union Baptist Church remember their former pastor Reverend Harvey Johnson and his wife Amelia E. Hall, an influential Afro-Canadian writer. In the 1880s, Johnson founded the Brotherhood of Liberty, one of the earliest Civil Rights groups in the nation. He fought for Civil Rights in the city’s courtrooms, writing: “there must be Negro lawyers, men who have themselves suffered and who will fight the people’s fight, because the people’s fight will be their own battle.” In 1905, Johnson built the sancturary for Union Baptist Church on Druid Hill Avenue where the congregation continues to worship today.\nLong-time residents of Morgan Park in northeast Baltimore remember their former neighbor W.E.B. Du Bois. He visited Baltimore regularly in the early 1900s, seeking advice on organizing and activism from Rev. Johnson at Union Baptist. In 1905, Du Bois wrote: “We claim for ourselves every right that belongs to a freeborn American—political, civil and social—and until we get these rights, we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of America with the story of its shameful deeds toward us.” In 1939, Du Bois and his wife Nina built a house on Montebello Terrace in Morgan Park. After Nina’s death in 1950, DuBois split his time between Baltimore and New York before leaving the United States for Ghana in 1962.\nLocal politicians both black and white, remember Victorine Q. Adams. She started her work in politics in the 1940s. She established the Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee to support politicians who opposed segregation and discrimination and the group, Woman Power, to get more black women involved in politics. At her home in Hanlon Park, Adams set up a voting machine and taught hundreds of black Baltimoreans how to vote for change. Finally, in 1968, Adams moved into a new office at Baltimore’s City Hall as the first black woman elected to the City Council.\nEveryone in Baltimore remembers the 2015 protests at the Western District Police Station following Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Through our research, we’ve learned that activists have a long history at the Mount Street police station. Activists picketed outside to protest police violence in 1966, 1969, 1972, and 1980.\nWe want to know what you remember about Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement.

    "contents": "\nA few weeks ago, I decided to apply for the Lord Baltimore Fellowship at the Maryland Historical Society to continue the research I started in 2015 on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments and Civil War memory in Baltimore. This week, I heard the good news that the Maryland Historical Society accepted my application. This year-long fellowship is unpaid but comes with the exciting opportunity of “staff-level” access to the Society’s library and archives.\nI began researching Confederate memory in June 2015 just a few days after the shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. I created a simple timeline on the history of Confederate monuments in Baltimore and published a blog post detailing the earliest local effort to erect a Confederate monument in 1880. That fall, I put together a detailed report for Baltimore Heritage and presented testimony before the Special Commission to Review Baltimore’s Public Confederate Monuments.\nOf course, my own interest on this topic has a history of its’ own. A July 2011 archaeological dig to explore the Civil War camp and hospital at West Baltimore’s Lafayette Square and a Civil War bike tour in November led to a presentation at the Society for Historical Archaeology in January 2012 on the meaning of public archaeology and Civil War history in historically black neighborhoods. In November 2013, I put together a tour of Mount Vernon Place on the histories of slavery and emancipation. You can find my rough notes for that tour in the Baltimore Heritage open tour collection.\nWhy am I sharing all this back story? I think it is important for everyone, myself included, to think about how our knowledge of the past is built up over time. Our understanding of the past as individuals and communities is directly shaped by the politics of the places where we live and learn.\nAfter the publication of the Special Commission’s final report in September 2016 and the installation of new interpretive plaques at each of the Confederate monuments considered in the city’s review, there has been little public discussion around Baltimore’s Confederate monuments. Without funding or more active leadership by Baltimore’s Mayor or City Council, all four monuments seem likely to stay in place for the near future.\nIn New Orleans, however, the removal of four monuments associated with white supremacy and the Confederacy began in April and ended on May 19, 2017. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu marked removal of the last of the four monuments with a widely-circulated speech explaining the city’s decision to take them down:\n\nSo relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, this is not about blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once.\nThis is, however, about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile and most importantly, choose a better future for ourselves making straight what has been crooked and making right what was wrong. Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price with discord, with division and yes with violence.\n\nI feel confident that Baltimore is not done talking about Confederate monuments and Civil War memory. Given the Maryland Historical Society’s own history in shaping local Civil War memory and importance role as a place where collections related to both the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement have found a home, the institution seems like the perfect place to take a closer look at these topics. If you’re interested, you can read my research proposal below. I’d love to hear your questions or suggestions for my research in the year ahead.\nBaltimore has a notable number of Confederate monuments for a city that remained with the Union throughout the Civil War. There are three Confederate monuments located in the city’s public parks and medians: the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1903) on Mount Royal Avenue, the Confederate Women’s Monument (1917) on University Parkway, and the Lee-Jackson Monument (1948) located at Wyman Park Dell. A fourth statue on Mount Vernon Place—the Roger Brooke Taney Monument (1887)—memorializes a Maryland lawyer and Supreme Court Justice whose decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case earned him lasting infamy as an opponent of black freedom.\nConfederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument, Mount Royal Avenue, c. 1903. Courtesy Library of Congress, det.4a10969.Many other monuments and statues have connections to Civil War memory—some obvious but others obscure. Thes include memorial statues to the Confederate dead in Loudon Park Cemetery; the enormous 1909 Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument relocated from Druid Hill Park to Wyman Park Dell in 1959; a 1911 monument to Confederate veteran John Mifflin Hood located at Preston Gardens since 1963; a 1919 statue of Confederate veteran and Baltimore Mayor Thomas G. Hayes at City Hall.\nReminders of Civil War memory are seen in the red and white symbol of the “Crossland Banner” in the Maryland State Flag (officially adopted in 1904) and heard in the state song, “Maryland, My Maryland” adopted in 1939. The Maryland Historical Society itself put on numerous exhibitions of Civil War art and artifacts over the institution’s history. In October 1947, the Maryland Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy worked with the Maryland Historical Society to open an exhibition of Confederate relics for students in Baltimore City public schools. In 1968, the addition of the Thomas and Hugg Building included a “Union Room” established to supplement the long-standing “Confederate Room”.\nAlthough scholarly research on the Civil War in Maryland is extensive, histories of Civil War memory in Maryland are harder to find. Charles W. Mitchell covers the topic in the epilogue to his extensive compendium Maryland Voices of the Civil War. Other historians, notably  David Blight in his influential 2002 study Race and Reunion or Paul Shackel in his 2003 book Memory in Black and White, have looked at the significant role of Civil War battlefields and related memorials as sites of conflict and reconciliation.\nMy own 2015 research on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments has inspired my current interest in looking at the broader picture of Civil War memory in Baltimore and exploring how the monuments fit within a landscape of visual and literary culture created by Confederate and Union veterans, their descendants, and scholars who studied the Civil War from the nineteenth century up to the present. Within this landscape, the central importance of education, such as textbooks and approaches to teaching Civil War history, stands out as a subject that demands deeper consideration.\nIn addition, I’m interested in unpacking the largely obscure political dimensions of Civil War memory in Baltimore. For example, in 1887, Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe refused to appear at the dedication of the Taney Monument at Mount Vernon Place to protest the prominent speaking role granted to his political antagonist Severn Teackle Wallis. In 1948, the Afro-American Newspaper responded to Governor William Preston Lane Jr.’s remarks at the dedication of the Lee-Jackson Monument at Wyman Park Dell by challenging his support from the Southern Governors’ Association and their opposition to desegregation of public universities. In both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Confederate monuments cannot be separated from the politics of the people who supported their erection. I believe the enduring legacy of local expressions of Civil War memory cannot truly be understood or evaluated without putting the topic in conversation with the history of the politics surrounding race and Civil Rights movement.\nGiven the breadth of the Maryland Historical Society’s collections there are several potential directions for how I could use the available resources to further this research. Relevant materials include the papers of Confederate veterans like Adalbert J. Volck (MS 867); early historians of the Confederacy such as J. Thomas Scharf (MS 1999); institutions that served Confederate veterans directly such as the Confederate Maryland Line Beneficial Association (MS 255) and the Maryland Line Confederate Soldiers’ Home (PP159; MS 256); individuals who directly participated in the creation and dedication of Confederate monuments such as Colonel Benjamin Franklin Taylor (MS 1863). Additional context on the process of commissioning of public artwork during the early twentieth century might be found in the records of the Municipal Arts Society (MS 2875). One of the most significant collections available for this research is the records of the United Daughters of the Confederacy covering the period from 1936 to 1984 (MS 2846). The availability of records from the 1960s and 1970s suggests the possibility of learning more about the group’s reaction to such efforts as the creation of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) in 1969 or the Negro Soldier Monument originally located next to the Battle Monument in 1972.\nThe overall goal of this effort, however, is not just to satisfy my curiosity with a detailed scholarly study or unearth forgotten records from the archives. Instead, I hope to explore new ways to make Civil War memory relevant and meaningful to Baltimore residents in the present. I’m especially interested in how to make the topic relevant to young people; a goal that, perhaps ironically, many “Lost Cause” historians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century shared.\nConnecting African American audiences with Civil War history has been a challenge for many contemporary public historians. Writer and Baltimore native Ta-Nehisi Coates reflected in a 2011 NPR interview on how African Americans have been excluded from the interpretation of the Civil War through “Lost Cause” mythologies. Coates remarked that, “one of the most depressing things [he] found,” was when a tour guide at the Gettysburg Battlefield park told him, “‘You can sit there for hours — and you can count on one hand the number of African-Americans that come into the battle park.’” In a 2012 article for The Atlantic magazine, Coates describes how the “country’s battlefields are marked with the enduring evidence” of the “tireless efforts” by Confederate descendants to present their own story of the Civil War—a story that, despite their defeat in the conflict, erased their ancestors complicity with the system of slavery that Confederate troops had fought for and died trying to preserve.\nIn 2015, the Charleston church shooting pushed the topic of Confederate memory to the front of public debates in a new way. The often contentious debates that followed have made it difficult to ignore the continued political significance of Civil War memory as an issue. With this study, I hope to find ways of using the history of Civil War memory to support constructive conversations on the relationship between memorials and politics in the past and in the future.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nI met with a colleague over coffee at the new Greenmount Coffee Lab to share advice on organizing a two hour walking tour program later this spring. When I got back to my desk, I thought the advice might be worth writing up into a quick tutorial.\nIn my experience, it takes about five hours to plan a two-hour-long walking tour program. It may take you more or less time depending on your background and how you approach the tour. The process I use works best for guided walking tours where you already have information about most or all of the tour sites. If you are planning a guided bike tours or bus tours or any self-guided tour, you may need to tweak this approach. If you are just getting started and do not know what tour sites might be appropriate to visit, you may need to do more research before you plan your walking tour.\nPlanning your walking tour with a map, schedule, and notes\n1. Make a map of your tour route\nUse geojson.io (advanced) or Google My Maps (beginner)\nMark any stops where you want to spend a longer amount of time\nStops include public artworks, prominent buildings, local businesses, plaques or signage, parks, etc.\n\nDraw a route on your map that connects all of the long stops\nTry draw a detailed and accurate route (e.g. show where the route crosses a street)\nTry to draw a route that ends at or near the same location the route began\nIf the tour seems too long (distance or duration), try drawing a variation on the route that excludes some stops\nIf the tour seems too short (distance or duration), try drawing a variation on the route that follows an indirect path or includes more long stops\n\nFill in any stops along the route where you want to spend a shorter amount of time\nShort stops can give participants an opportunity to catch up and keep the tour group together\nShort stops can also be a good opportunity to share interesting information that is not directly related to the main theme of the tour\n\n2. Make a schedule for your tour stops\nMake a table (use Google Docs or Markdown)\nAdd columns to your table for:\nthe name of each stop\nthe duration of each stop (or separate columns for arrival and departure times)\nbrief notes\n\nFill in the schedule table:\nList out each stop as a separate row\nList out the amount of time to spend at each stop\nAdd in time for questions and discussion\nAdd in time for moving between stops\nAdd in any relevant notes for each stop\n\n3. Write your tour notes\nCreate headings for each of the longer stops\nAdd sub-headings for shorter stops\nHeadings should typically include:\na related place name\na date of construction\nan address\ne.g. Old Town National Bank/Holiday Inn (1925) - 221 N. Gay Street\n\nYou can see examples of tour notes on Baltimore Heritage Open Tours\nIf you want to share your tour notes and collect comments from co-organizers or neighbors in advance, you can use Google Docs to share your tour notes and invite readers to share comments.\n4. Try out the tour in advance\nLook out for issues with physical accessibility (e.g. stairs, steep grades, missing curb cuts, uneven pavement)\nLook out for issues with physical comfort (e.g. loud noises, unpleasant smells)\nIdentify where the tour guide should stand and the participants should stand at each stop\nIdentify any amenities available along the route (e.g. bathrooms, coffee shops)\n5. Revise the map, schedule, and notes as needed\nIf you have enough time between when you try out your tour and the day you lead the tour, you may want to incorporate revisions into your map, schedule, or notes. Try to be realistic about how much time you need to lead participants through the narrative and travel between each stop. Good tours always end on time.\nAdditional considerations when planning walking tours\nI’m hoping to update this post with links and more information when I have more time. Here are a few more important topics to consider:\nResearching walking tour sites\nPromoting a walking tour\nKeeping people engaged during a walking tour\nRevising and adapting your walking tour notes\nBeing kind and inclusive when communicating with tour participants\nIf you have any suggestions for existing resources on these topics or ideas for other topics a walking tour guide should address, please let me know @elipousson or share them on Twitter with the #localpast hashtag.\n\n\n\n",
