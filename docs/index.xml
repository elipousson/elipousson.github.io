  <title>Taking down bandit signs in Baltimore</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve been taking down illegally posted “We Buy Houses” signs (a.k.a. bandit signs) for several years now. I post about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/banditsigns">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/banditsigns/">Instagram</a> using the #banditsigns hashtag and people sometimes ask me why I do it.</p>
<p>In short, the signs are illegally posted and are often associated with scam “investors” who exploit seniors (and others) with deceptive tactics and below market offers. This <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/buy-houses-investors-target-seniors-with-below-market-offers/34c9nhExtYBB88QivDTeEP/">2019 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article</a> or this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/u-s-states-take-aim-as-house-wholesalers-flood-poor-areas">more recent article from Bloomberg</a> are both helpful introductions to the issue. Elected officials in Pittsburgh recently <a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/lawrenceville-united-offering-rewards-for-pittsburgh-we-buy-houses-signs/Content?oid=19770552">called for state regulation of “wholesale” buyers</a> who use these signs. Last year, the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/wholesaler-or-huckster-philly-council-passes-bill-to-curb-real-estate-scammers/">Philadelphia City Council passed a bill</a> to protect city homeowners from similar scams. Taking down the signs makes it harder for people using these practices to reach people and take advantage of them.</p>
<p>Over the past six months, I’ve taken down around 60 illegally posted “We Buy Houses” signs while riding around Baltimore City for work or errands.<sup>1</sup> 50 of these signs have been located in or near the 12th City Council District where I live.</p>
<p>I thought it might be interesting to try to dig into the data on illegal signs in the district and compare the data to my own observations (while also showing off a few new features for the mapbaltimore package).</p>
<p>I’ll start off by getting the boundaries for the 12th District and making a simple base map:</p>

<p>R mapping nerds may also appreciate this example of how to use the <code>patchwork::inset_element()</code> function to overlay a small key map.</p>
<p>Next, I want to look at the distribution of illegally posted signs using data on <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/311-customer-service-request-spatialized-2021/explore">311 service requests from Open Baltimore</a>. Anyone can use the 311 website or app to report “illegal signs on public property or public right-of-way.” The city tells users they can expect the city to “investigate and issue a citation to the responsible party if appropriate” within 15 business days.</p>
<p>I also want to look at requests on “Illegal Sign Removal” which is only used “internally” (i.e.&nbsp;users can’t submit a request in this category) and are handled by the Department of Transportation (instead of the Department of Housing and Community Development).</p>
<p>The <code>mapbaltimore::get_area_requests()</code> function makes this easy. The function returns 2021 requests by default. I’m also using <code>purrr::map_dfr()</code> to request multiple types in succession then return a single data frame. I’m also removing duplicate addresses to avoid overplotting.</p>

<p>This quick map shows how the “illegal sign removal” requests are largely used on major streets (e.g.&nbsp;Martin Luther King Boulevard, North Avenue and Charles Street). Reports of illegal signs on public property also look like they are clustered in certain areas. East Baltimore Midway stands out near the northeast corner of the map with a large number of reports. I suspect that this may be the result of a handful of dedicated individuals reporting every illegal sign they can find in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those dedicated individuals, over the past year, illegal sign requests don’t seem to go anywhere. Among the 143 service requests for “illegal signs” submitted in 2021, 113 are “open”, 30 are “new”, and none are “closed.”</p>

<p>So, what if the city <em>does</em> investigates an illegal sign report and issues a citation? Unfortunately, the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/environmental-citations/explore">citation data on Open Baltimore</a> for “Prohibited Posting of Signs on Public Property” from is basically useless for mapping.<sup>2</sup> This means I can’t look at “prohibited posting” citations just in the 12th District but I <em>can</em> look at citations citywide to answer two basic questions. First, when are citations issued? Second, are citations actually paid?</p>

<p>After the city issued an unusually large number of “prohibited posting” citations in 2018, they issued just 70 in 2019, 50 in 2020, and only 7 in 2021. Clearly, illegal signs have not been a priority during the pandemic—although the significant drop in citations also includes the prior year.</p>

<p>When you look at citation status, however, you might wonder if it even matters if “prohibited posting” citations are issued or not. Less 5% of all citations in the past decade have been paid. Most of the people who post “We Buy Houses” signs use Google Voice or other VOIP services to make it more difficult to match the signs to a business or address. The signs themselves are cheap (one to two dollars each if you buy a couple hundred at a time) so the risks of getting in trouble are limited.</p>
<p>I’m a big 311 enthusiast but I rarely bother submitting requests for illegally posted signs both because the city can rarely cite anyone and because it can take a long time for the city to come out and take a sign down. So, how do the locations of the signs I’m taking down compare to the locations for “illegal sign” service requests?</p>
<p>Again, the <code>exifr::read_exif()</code> function makes this easy. My <a href="https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2021-03-06-creating-a-key-map-for-photographs-with-r/">post on making a photo key map with R</a> back in March may be helpful for anyone wanting to learn more about this approach.</p>

<p>This may not be a big surprise but this map illustrates how 311 service request data really isn’t representative of the overall scale or distribution of this issue. I take down signs in Oliver and Barclay more often than almost anywhere else and there are almost no illegal sign service requests from either neighborhood. The same goes for McElderry Park located right outside the 12th district on near the southeast corner of the map.</p>
<p>In the end, though, you don’t need perfect data to address this issue. You just need 20 seconds to take down a bandit sign next time you see one. And the next time and the next time—until the scammers stop putting them up.</p>

  <title>Making a map of libraries around my neighborhood</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The Enoch Pratt Free Library—Baltimore’s public library system—recently <a href="https://www.prattlibrary.org/about-us/covid-19-updates/pratt-library-reopening">reopened for in-person browsing</a> for the first time in nearly a year. This past Sunday, I visited the Enoch Pratt’s Clifton branch for the first time and I really enjoyed the novelty of exploring a new library after so many months away from any library at all. My ten-year-old daughter shared my excitement so we started talking about the idea of visiting <em>every</em> public library in the city this spring and summer.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2021-03-23-mapping-libraries-near-me/images/2021-03-20_pratt-library-clifton-branch.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Child giving two thumbs-up standing in front of a brick branch library building.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When we made it back home, I decided to make a simple map we could use to keep track of the libraries as we go. We usually ride our bikes when we visit the library so I also wanted to show the distance between each library and our neighborhood. The map is simple but I’m happy with how it turned out so I wanted to write up the approach. It shows off a few ways to handle label placement but I’m really hoping it might entice a few neighbors into visiting a few more libraries this spring as well.</p>
<p>To start, I loaded ggplot2 and dplyr packages, and my own mapbaltimore package. I’m also using a couple functions from sf, purrr, and stringr.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;

</div>
<p>Next, I pulled in the boundary of the Harwood neighborhood where I live, found the center of the neighborhood using the <code>st_centroid</code> function, and applied a buffer ranging from one to six miles. Including the approximate mileage is especially helpful since I’m hoping we can bike to most (if not all) of these libraries before the summer heat sets in.</p>

<p>We can take a quick look at how these elements come together. I set the already set theme to <code>theme_void()</code> but I updated the defaults for <code>geom_text</code>, created a background layer (<code>layer_city</code>) that combines the detailed physical boundary of the city (<code>baltimore_city_detailed</code>) with the simple administrative boundary (<code>baltimore_city</code>), and created layers for the buffered areas and labels.</p>

<p>For the next step, we need the locations for the libraries. <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/library-1">Open Baltimore</a> provides access to a GeoJSON file with the location of the Central Library and all of the branches which I can quickly import using the <code>read_sf</code> function.</p>

<p>To avoid these overlapping labels and try out a more distinctive style, I decided to divide up the libraries into three groups—libraries in east and northeast Baltimore (mostly), libraries in north and northwest Baltimore (mostly), and libraries everywhere else.</p>

<p>I should be clear that figuring out which library belonged in which group took a bit of trial and error. I’m using the <code>hjust</code> parameter to left align the text for libraries in northeast and east Baltimore then right align everything else and I’m using the <code>angle</code>, <code>nudge_x</code>, and <code>nudge_y</code> parameters to push the text to the appropriate side of the diamond shape I used to mark each library location.</p>

<p>I exported the finished map with <code>ggsave</code>, printed it out, and checked off the two libraries we’ve visited so far. This morning, my daughter circled one more. She had mentioned our new map to her math teacher and, after her teacher told her which branch she usually uses and gave it a good review, my daughter started making a plan for us to visit this weekend. I can’t wait.</p>

  <title>Baltimore Data Day: How are people using data on Open Baltimore?</title>
  <dc:creator>Eli Pousson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2018-07-13-open-baltimore/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I had the opportunity to participate in Baltimore Data Day again this year as part of a panel discussion on Open Baltimore, the city’s seven-year-old open data portal. The narrative notes from my presentation are below and should (mostly) match up with <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18acVed8lYoFREfHrJ7SZKwD4onk4gYYeRXgIhyjo0xI/edit?usp=sharing">my Google Slides</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation is based in part on my rough analysis of the Open Baltimore public asset inventory including a look at just the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lyEHlaM-9hPfp38h8K_IMuK7kG9OD9_T9wfTuwXkAZ8/edit?usp=sharing">community or custom views of data</a> created by registered Open Baltimore users and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1URIuecV0SMCQN0NAkzZjH6O89qaZ4c3JL6yNh5aj7nk/edit?usp=sharing">official datasets</a> (excluding derived views like maps or visualization). I used a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%40OpenBaltimore&amp;src=typd">Twitter search for mentions of @OpenBaltimore</a> to collect examples of past reactions and complaints. And, I also <a href="https://twitter.com/elipousson/status/1014888840388104192">shared my initial findings on Twitter</a> while soliciting feedback from local residents who have used Open Baltimore. I combined this recent history with a closer look at the history of GIS that I compiled into a <a href="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1pflqm9xKafOmsGlSVyL4ORdr1A65v0EnTTChMid8TQM&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=650">rough timeline</a> (also available in an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pflqm9xKafOmsGlSVyL4ORdr1A65v0EnTTChMid8TQM/edit#gid=0">open Google Sheet</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m here today because I’m a data nerd and Baltimore City resident who is equally enthusiastic about using, praising, and criticizing Open Baltimore. Like many others, I’m frustrated by all the ways in which Open Baltimore doesn’t work. And I’ll be talking about those frustrations today. But I also want to start by urging everyone to see fixing these problems as a shared responsibility. By listening to one another’s experiences, I think we can make Open Baltimore better and make Baltimore better at the same time.</p>
<p>So let’s start with a look at the recent history of people using Open Baltimore.</p>
<p>The first data set uploaded to Open Baltimore—a GIS shapefile of building footprints—was added on January 21, 2011. Northeast Baltimore resident Rob Walshe created the first custom view on Open Baltimore just five days later when he created a list of 311 service requests for graffiti removal in the neighborhoods of Hamilton and Gardenville.</p>
<p>Over seven years have passed and eight hundred people have created accounts on Open Baltimore to create their own custom views of the city’s open data. This group of users include residents in Medfield, Oliver, Violetville, Homeland, and Howard Park. Some use Open Baltimore to learn about their neighborhoods. Others use the data in their work as journalists, educators, organizers, and researchers. While most people only ever create a single custom view, some create multiple views—often on behalf of a community group.</p>
<p>You can judge the popularity of Open Baltimore data sets by page views or downloads but I am more interested in the people who are trying to <em>do something</em> with the data beyond just looking at it. So today, we are looking at these users and the data they’re using including:</p>
<ul>
<li>victim-based crimes</li>
<li>311 customer service requests</li>
<li>vacant building notices</li>
<li>arrests</li>
<li>and 911 calls</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, people have created nearly fourteen hundred custom views based on just these five data sets—totalling over seventy percent of the custom views created on Open Baltimore since 2011.</p>
<p>But, despite their consistent interest in using the data published on Open Baltimore, resident experiences with the service are a mix of education, empowerment, and aggravation.</p>
<p>One Howard Park resident, John Schladen, started using Open Baltimore in November 2012 and started working with his neighbors to document vacant buildings in their neighborhood. In a <a href="http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2015/03/howard-park-exploring-baltimores-neighborhoods/#1">March 2015 interview</a> with the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, John noted the importance of data on housing for residents in Howard Park:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If we can begin to understand our own condition as a community, we’re going to have much more power.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between January 2014 and November 2015, Samantha Armacost created twenty-five custom views on Open Baltimore on behalf of the Medfield Community Assoication. But, in 2015, she grew frustrated after changes in the availability of victim-based crime data undermined her efforts make sense of public safety in her community. She no longer uses the site.</p>
<p>Unpredictable coverage wasn’t the only concern for residents or researchers. In an <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/22921/413219-Partner-s-Perspective-NNIP-and-Open-Data-in-Baltimore.PDF">August 2014 report</a> Eric Burnstein and Seema Iyer, noted the difficulty of using the “rounded address” (the unit block number and street name) to assign incidents to neighborhoods. As a result, the 2014 publication of BNIA-JFI’s annual “Vital Signs” report “excluded many crime indicators for the first time since its inception.”</p>
<p>Journalist Danielle Sweeney started using Open Baltimore in August 2015 as part of her reporting for the Baltimore Brew on <a href="https://baltimorebrew.com/2015/08/26/a-burglar-in-your-bedroom-a-mugger-with-a-gun/">police responses to property crime</a>. By April 2017, when she turned to Twitter in frustration, writing: “No one ever answers my questions.” Fortunately, Danielle was not disuaded and actually expanded her use of the site in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>While Open Baltimore may not be responsible for the errors and inconsistency in the data provided by city agencies, poor communication does little to correct any misconceptions. User comments on <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/911-Police-Calls-for-Service/xviu-ezkt/data">911 call data point</a> out missing and incorrect information without any offiial reponse.</p>
<p>The footer of Open Baltimore encourages people to <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/nominate">“nominate a dataset”</a> but the published comments highlight the confusion experienced by many individuals using the site. People are looking for data sets that are <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/nominate/6302">already available</a> and wondering what happened to data that has <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/nominate/6609">disappeared from public view</a>. People report issues with incorrect or <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/nominate/3458">missing data</a>. Few comments of any kind have been published lately. No “dataset suggestions” have been marked as “approved” since February 18, 2014. Users submitted 148 suggestions over the first five years of Open Baltimore’s operation. Over the last two and a half years, only twenty-one suggestions have been submitted. Given the lack of response to prior submissions, people could be forgiven for deciding that trying to request new data on Open Baltimore may not be worth the trouble.</p>
<p>Of course, Open Baltimore isn’t the only source for data and public information from city agencies. And these other sources have their own challenges: confusing interfaces, inaccessible web design, and dated technical infrastructure. You don’t need take my word for it. Please try finding data and information on a few of these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baltimore City Health Department <a href="http://baltimore.foodinspectionreports.com">Food Facility Inspection Reports database</a></li>
<li>The Department of Planning’s <a href="https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/maps-data/online-community-association-directory">Community Association Directory</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://bllcrecords.baltimorecity.gov">database of applications, inspection reports, and other documents</a> from the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City</li>
<li>Baltimore Housing’s <a href="http://cels.baltimorehousing.org/codemap/codeMap.html">codeMap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Can you find the information you need using these sites? Do you feel like the information is accurate and up to date? If not, why not? <!-- Add a mention for Councilman Brandon Scott's role in getting the health department and 911 data up online. --></p>
<p>All to often, residents searching for essential public information run into frustrating and disappointing road blocks. <a href="http://openbudget.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Budget Baltimore</a> created by the Bureau of the Budget and Management Research is just one revealing example of this problem. The site tells visitors that the “data that powers Open Budget” is “available to you.” But my recent attempt to follow the link data led back to Open Baltimore where I was confronted by a message tell me to go “Back to where you came from.” Is this what it feels like to have your own city gas-lighting you?</p>
<p>I truly don’t want to spend our time together on a re-visiting past complaints. Instead, I’d like to find a way to bridge the gap between the aspirations and dreams we’ve brought to Open Baltimore and the experiences it offers for people in Baltimore today.</p>
<p>For people who believe in the power of data to make the city a better place, you should remember that you are part of a long tradition.</p>
<p>In February 1907, Theodore Marburg, founder and president of the Municipal Art Society, gathered “City and State officials, heads of city departments, City Councilmen and leaders of the thought of a great university” for a “round table” and “smoker” in the Hotel Rennert (where the Charles Center parking lot stands today) to listen to “expositions of the advantages and benefits to be derived” from the city’s new Legislative Reference Department headed by Dr.&nbsp;Horace E. Flack. Before a group of twenty-five White men who sat around a table sipping cups of punch and smoking “fragrant cigars” in the hotel’s “cafe clubroom,” Marburg proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In this hour of change, the most thorough investigation into a city problem made today may be out of date tomorrow. The price of intelligent action is constant investigation. …The money value of adequate data on things we are about to do is difficult to measure.”</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The costs of ignorance may be difficult to measure but we’ve lived with them for as long as Baltimore has been around. For people who are frustrated with the state of open data in Baltimore today, you are also part of a long tradition.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise to learn that the Citizen’s Planning and Housing Association (CPHA), for example, has created one hundred and fifty custom views on Open Baltimore—more than any other single user. CPHA has a long history of advocating for city staff and elected officials to improve the ways they organize and share data about housing, transportation, and countless other issues. In one 1965 editorial that sounds all too familiar, the organization observed:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CPHA’s advocacy led to the creation of the Department of Housing and Community Development in 1968 and, by the mid-1970s, the creation of the city’s first “Vacant House File”—a collection of punch cards created for use with a mainframe computer. Today, using <a href="http://cels.baltimorehousing.org/codemap/codeMap.html">codeMap</a>, anyone can find answers to at least some of these questions.</p>
<p>What can we take away from this recent history and the much longer history that preceded it? Here are a few ideas for what the staff reponsible for Open Baltimore and everyone who plays a part in opening access to public data online could consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The limits or quirks of Socrata may be one source of the problems with Open Baltimore. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that it is the only part or even the most important part.</li>
<li>Consistent location data is key to ensuring inter-operability and ease of reuse by residents and researchers alike.</li>
<li>Open Baltimore and all of the city’s online services need to put a higher priority on accessibility and education.</li>
<li>Open Baltimore needs meaningful and useful opportunities for feedback that can be used by both city staff and residents.</li>
</ul>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This is the first part of the draft of <a href="https://elipousson.github.io/research/2017/11/30/tear-it-down/">a paper I’m working on</a> about the politics of Project CORE and the history of demolition in Baltimore. Comments or suggestions are welcome! You can also see the photos and links I’ve been collecting for this project using the hashtag #baltimoredemolition on <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtag/baltimoredemolition">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/baltimoredemolition/">Instagram</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>About a week ago, on March 27, 2018, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan held a press conference in front of six boarded-up vacant houses on the 1000 block of N. Stockton Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Built between 1886 and 1896<!-- Likely before 1892 since 1136 N. Stockton Street is built by that time. See https://search.proquest.com/hnpbaltimoresun/docview/535401728/9AAB2DFE01A4C6DPQ/11?accountid=10750 -->, the two-story houses had been slated for demolition for over a year with funding from Project CORE, a state program created to expand the demolition of vacant buildings in Baltimore City.<sup>1</sup> Hogan used the occasion to <a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/2018/03/27/governor-larry-hogan-announces-latest-phase-of-project-c-o-r-e-initiative/">announce the newest phase of Project CORE</a>: the planned demolition of five hundred more abandoned buildings that Pugh claimed in a joint statement “provide a haven for criminal activity in neighborhoods most at risk.”</p>

<p>In his speech, Hogan described plans to tear down “decaying and dangerous properties in the highest violent crime areas where the most criminal gang activity is occurring,” suggesting that the city had “designated and prioritized” the targeted vacant buildings as “a contributing factor to violent crime in those communities.” He observed that “vacant and blighted structures too often contribute to the sale and use of illegal drugs and other criminal gang activity” but demolition, together with increased support from state police and proposed legislation to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-wants-to-double-the-sentence-for-repeat-offenders-who-commit-a-felony-with-a-gun/2017/12/05/6040d994-d9ce-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?utm_term=.095c499d3057">doubling the minimum sentence</a> for repeat felonies involving a gun can improve public safety in Sandtown-Winchester. Hogan then got behind the controls of a John Deere 450D excavator and, with help from a contractor, started tearing down those six houses on Stockton Street.</p>

<p>Pugh offered a similar message when she <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorPugh50/status/978657134845026305">shared a video of the demolition on Twitter</a>, writing: “We are taking them down so that we can build-up our communities. Our citizens and young people deserve this and so much more.” The city’s recently drafted <a href="http://greennetwork.civicomment.org/">Baltimore Green Network Plan</a> proposed replacing the vacant houses on Stockton Street and nearby blocks with Smithson Park. The city plans to work with neighborhood residents, represented by the Sandtown South Neighborhood Alliance and the Western District Community Relations Council, to find funding, design, and build the new neighborhood park.<sup>2</sup> Smithson Park is one of several pilot projects the plan sketched out for west Baltimore neighborhoods Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, Druid Heights, and Upton.</p>
<p>Online reactions to the announcement varied. <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraBaile2/status/978661156192743424">Laura Baile</a> responded to a video of Hogan’s <a href="https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/978642175377358849">announcement on Twitter</a>: “Great news. Too many junkies hang out in those abandoned Townhomes and Rob people.” <a href="https://twitter.com/SanderMednick/status/978694100361891840">Sander Mednick</a> responded to Pugh: “Start boasting when you actually build something useful. Until then this is much ado about nothing… a rat relocation program.”</p>

<p>The idea that tearing down buildings improves public safety and reduces crime isn’t unique to Baltimore. A handful of recent examples—Detroit, Michigan in 2010, Camden, New Jersey in 2015, and Chicago, Illinois in 2016—illustrate the recent enthusiasm of elected officials for demolition. About eight years ago, on March 23, 2010, Detroit’s mayor Dave Bing made the case for demolition in his first State of the City address:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Blight is more than an eye sore. Abandoned and dilapidated buildings are hot spots for crime and a living reminder of owners who turned a blind eye and neglected their properties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By April, the city had started work on the demolition of an initial group of one thousand vacant houses selected by the city’s Police, Fire and Buildings &amp; Safety Engineering departments using 2009 arson and crime statistics.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In 2015, Camden’s mayor Dana Redd spoke at the demolition of 1510 Louis Street making a similar case:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For many years, we know our residents have battled with blight, crime, and decay… We know safe corridors can really be safe corridors when we remove these vacant properties.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redd shared the plan to remove six hundred houses using funding from the city, Community Development Block Grant program, and a public bond issue.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In 2016, Chicago Alderman Carrie Austin stood in front of a demolition site on the 200 block of West 113th Street and explainined how residents asked her to “beg the city to take them down.” She said demolition would strengthen the community:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We can rid our community of drug-infested buildings, prostitution and every illegal activity that could possibly be in a community. This effort will strengthen this community once and again.<sup>6</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This recent surge in connecting demolition to policing and public safety predated the beginning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">national foreclosure crisis</a> in late 2007. <a href="https://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/app/legacy/documents/true-costs.pdf">Vacant Properties: The True Costs to Communities</a>, an influential 2005 publication by the National Vacant Properties Campaign (established in 2002 by Smart Growth America), sought to help planners and elected officials understand “the many and varied costs that vacant and abandoned properties impose upon communities” by gathering quantitative research on costs associated with city services (nuisance abatement, crime and fire prevention), decreased property values and tax revenues, and costs to resident home-owners. Crime featured prominently in the list of municipal services but report did not offer any estimates of the “monetary cost” before concluding “it is clear that vacant properties burden police departments.”<sup>7</sup> As evidence, the report cited the now infamous “broken windows” theory popularized by criminal justice scholar George Kelling and James Q. Wilson in a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true">1982 article</a> for <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p>
<p>Twenty years earlier, Wilson and Kelling argued that, “at the community level, disorder and crime are usually inextricably linked, in a kind of developmental sequence.” They presented vacant buildings not only as potential sites for criminal activity but an enticement for law-breaking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder and even for people who ordinarily would not dream of doing such things and who probably consider themselves law-abiding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While many now find this argument suspect, it is important to recognize that proponents of aggressive policing are not the only people calling for the demolition of vacant buildings. Baltimore’s Black residents have a long history of seeking relief from the hazards of vacant buildings concentrated in historically segregated Black neighborhoods.<sup>8</sup> It is clear that vacant and abandoned housing is a symptom of broader systemic problems—automobile-centered development and racial segregation foremost among them—but the hazards, financial costs, and stigma largely effect people living nearby.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>People living near vacant buildings worry over their own safety and the safety of their neighbors. Elected officials and city residents find common ground in beautification—making neighborhoods more attractive place for existing residents and people traveling through—and in public health and safety—keeping neighbors safe from poor housing conditions, violent crime, and addiction.</p>
<p>Baltimore Police Commissioner Edward V. Woods heard demands for demolition from at least one resident on Friday, June 26, 1992 when he visited the 900 block of E. Biddle Street to meet the family of s three-year-old boy, Andre Antonio Dorsey, killed by a stray bullet two days earlier. Regardless of any planned police response, the boy’s mother, Felicia Dorsey, was ready to leave, saying, “Even if the police do try to do something more in the neighborhood, I’m not planning on even staying around to see it. I’m moving.” On a brief walk around the block, Woods met a twenty-year-old neighbor, Denise Lewis, who offered the commissioner some advice: “tear all these rotten houses down and build the kids a playground.”<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Lewis recognized that demolition alone wasn’t enough. Kids in East Baltimore needed safe, well-maintained recreational spaces. But, even as Woods listened with a sympathetic ear, the city’s budget reflected a different set of priorities. In 1992, the city’s Police Department employed 3,594 people (about twenty percent of the city’s total) compared to 803 people employed at the Department of Recreation and Parks (not even five percent of the city’s total). The police had a program budget of $181,695,068—more than five times the $34,052,350 program budget for recreation and parks.<sup>11</sup></p>

</div>
<p>Two decades later, around 2013, East Baltimore residents with Re-Build Johnston Square with organizing support from Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development (BUILD) began advocating for modest improvements in the maintenance of Ambrose Kennedy Park just one block south of the home where Dorsey was killed twenty-five years earlier.<sup>12</sup> Ultimately, the advocacy led to a 2016 grant application where the Parks &amp; People Foundation received over $400,000 for the improvement and expansion of the park. In 2017, construction began on the park improvements and, in early 2018, the city began tearing down houses on Eager and Valley Streets.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>While the improvements at Ambrose Kennedy Park are sure to improve the lives of Johnston Square residents, policing, not parks, remains the priority for local elected officials. Between 1992 and 2016, the gap in funding between the Baltimore’s police and parks grew nearly three times over.<sup>14</sup> The total number of police employees fell slightly to 3,259—but now made up nearly a quarter of the city’s total employees. Recreation and Parks employed 327 people in 2016—a little over two percent of the city’s total.</p>
<p>The limited funding for city parks and the planned expansion of parks under the Green Network Plan suggest that paying for maintenance is going to be an ongoing challenge.<sup>15</sup> In addition, not every vacant lot is turned into a park or playground. Whether vacant houses are replaced by parks or vacant lots, does demolition really improve public safety? I believe a sincere commitment to improved public safety in Johnston Square, Sandtown-Winchester, and every Baltimore neighborhood requires a different approach.<!-- Add information on the need for continued funding. Hasn't been interrogated. Are the ideas sound? They aren't new. Concerns in the past, same concerns today. --></p>

  <title>The politics of ‘tear it down’</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This spring, I’ll be presenting a paper at the 2018 Vernacular Architectural Forum on the meaning, history, and politics of demolition in Baltimore. My presentation is part of a panel, “Erasure in the Urban Vernacular Landscape,” with Susan Garfinkel, David Rotenstein, and Aaron Wunsch.</p>
<p>I’ve already done some research and writing on demolition for Project CORE (see my posts for Baltimore Heritage on the <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/preservation/project-core-mean-baltimores-historic-neighborhoods/">2016</a> and <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/preservation/project-core-shares-plan-demolition-149-vacant-buildings-2017/">2017 demolition review process</a>). With this paper, I’m hoping to look closer at the recent history of demolition in Baltimore (from the 1970s through the 2000s), conduct a few interviews with residents and policy-makers, and get a better understanding of the neighborhood and urban politics of demolition. If you’re a Baltimore resident and you are interested in talking about your experiences with demolition, please get in touch by email or on Twitter! I’m also sharing project photos on Instagram using the hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/baltimoredemolition/">#baltimoredemolition</a>. Read on for my abstract and I’ll try to share updates as I put together a draft over the next few months.</p>
<hr>
<p>Decades of demands by local residents and policy-makers to “fix up or tear down” vacant rowhouses in Baltimore, Maryland are expanding under Project CORE, a new program created in 2016 to provide millions in new state funding for local demolition priorities. While the program includes grant funding for stabilization and rehabilitation, the main goal is to erase blocks and blocks of the “blighted” mostly vacant rowhouses concentrated in the historically segregated districts of east and west Baltimore.</p>

<p>Tearing down old buildings while following state and federal preservation law and giving legal due process to private property owners, however, is more complicated than elected officials acknowledge when they promise to make the problems of the past disappear. What room do the politics and policy of demolition leave for residents to mourn the loss of a building or neighborhood? How do residents and advocates envision the benefits of demolition?</p>

  <title>Baltimore Data Day: Vacant housing, trash, and making data open in Harwood</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This post is a slightly revised version of my lunchtime lightning talk at Baltimore Data Day 2017. This script corresponds <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cSwVt61PVhqIHjh33ChkOKUBQ-1KNWbkc8KkVm-nVGI/edit#slide=id.p">to my slides</a>. Thanks to Ciara Christian for the opportunity to share my work around vacant housing, trash, and 311 data.</em></p>
<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Eli Pousson and I work for <a href="http://baltimoreheritage.org/">Baltimore Heritage</a>, a small nonprofit that advocates for historic preservation across the city. I’ll admit I’m a not a statistician or a GIS expert. I’m a professional historian and an amateur data nerd. I also won’t pretend to have any “objectivity” about vacant houses and trash in Harwood. I live in Harwood and I care about what happens in my neighborhood.</p>
</section>
<section id="harwood" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="harwood">Harwood</h3>
<p>Harwood isn’t the kind of neighborhood most people think about when you say the words “historic preservation.” It isn’t a historic district and our homes are mostly modest two-story rowhouses. But I like to think about preservation as the work of keeping old buildings in use and making old neighborhoods better places for the people who live there.</p>
</section>
<section id="harwood-park" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="harwood-park">Harwood Park</h3>
<p>Because old buildings aren’t the only places that need a little tender loving care. So, for nearly a year, I’ve been hanging out at <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/elipousson/sets/72157679365330883">Harwood Park</a> on the 400 block of E. 27th Street cleaning up a few times a month. If a clean park helps to create a more stable housing market, even in a small way, that helps old buildings in my neighborhood.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vacants-on-e.-27th-street">Vacants on E. 27th Street</h3>
<p>And old buildings in my neighborhood <em>need</em> help. These vacant houses stand right across the street from the park. Overall, the <a href="Greater Charles Village/Barlcay Community Statistical Area">Greater Charles Village/Barlcay Community Statistical Area</a> has a 5.4% vacancy rate—less than the city average. But, as most Baltimoreans know, you can’t ignore the challenge of unoccupied and neglected buildings that haven’t <em>yet</em> met the city’s requirements to issue an official vacant building notice.</p>
</section>
<section id="vacant-buildings-101" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vacant-buildings-101">Vacant Buildings 101</h3>
<p>This past winter, Baltimore Heritage partnered with the <a href="http://communitylaw.org/">Community Law Center</a> to develop a workshop we called <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/vacant-buildings-101/">Vacant Buildings 101</a> to teach community residents how to deal with vacant buildings. And the workshop gave me an opportunity to wonder: How can data help people deal with vacant buildings?</p>
<p>Data can help me to look at a vacant house and see more than just an “eyesore.” I can look and see if code enforcement is working for my neighborhood. I can use 311 data to build a case for a vacant building notice. I can learn when fighting for building rehabilitation and reuse makes sense and when stabilization or demolition may be the only option.</p>

<p>Of course, most folks don’t deal with vacant houses as data in a spreadsheet. They deal with vacants one at a time.</p>
<p>411 E. 27th Street is a single data point: a vacant building notice issued on February 19, 2015. One of thirty-five vacant building notices in Harwood. One of five on this block.</p>

<p>Vacant houses are not the only problem on this block. I may not have the money to fix up every old house in Harwood but I can do something about this mess on our our playground. And I can tell you that picking up garbage and using 311 to report illegal dumping is a great way to learn about using and making open data in your neighborhood.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="report-from-the-citizens-planning-housing-association">1965 report from the Citizens Planning &amp; Housing Association</h3>
<p>The challenge of gathering data and interpreting data on vacants has a long history. In a 1965 report, the <a href="http://www.cphabaltimore.org/">Citizens Planning &amp; Housing Association</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“No one person knows how many vacant houses are owned by the city, how many should be razed, how many have a known owner, how many are needed for other uses and how many are involved in some stage of the law enforcement process.”</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="where-does-data-come-from" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-does-data-come-from">Where does data come from?</h3>
<p>While we have a lot <em>more</em> of this data today, I can say with confidence that many of my neighbors don’t know where to find or how to interpret data on vacants in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>In addition, vacant building notices are tied to code enforcement actions. These actions are often triggered by 311 reports and we can expect people from different background to use 311 in different ways. This variation reveals the inherently uneven approach we use to identify and document issues in our neighborhoods.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="codemap-showing-parcels-with-vacant-building-notices">codeMap showing parcels with vacant building notices</h3>
<p>So let’s take a look at the data available to me and other residents interested in vacants and trash. <a href="http://cels.baltimorehousing.org/codemap/codeMap.html">codeMap</a> is a remarkable resource for giving residents, community advocates, and developers the opportunity to access much of the same data used by city planners and Housing Department to direct code enforcment officers, prioritize recievership cases, and budget funding for demolition and stabilization.</p>

<section id="rs-link-database-on-receivership-cases" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rs-link-database-on-receivership-cases">RS Link database on receivership cases</h3>
<p>codeMap also links out to a variety of data sources such as the RSLink database used by Baltimore Housing and One House at a Time to track receivership cases from the first filing to the final sale. I don’t think I’d call this “open” data, however. While you can see these records one at a time, everyday users are not able to search the database or create reports.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="carto-map-of-receivership-auction-results">CARTO map of receivership auction results</h3>
<p>The city doesn’t provide bulk access to this data so I decided reached out to <a href="http://onehousebaltimore.org">One House at a Time</a> directly. They shared their data on recievership auctions for 2015 and 2016 making it possible for us to create this map showing successful and unsucessful auctions across the city. Five houses in Harwood went through receivership in 2015 and 2016 and all five sold.</p>

<p>Back to E. 27th Street. One of the key lessons here is that just because you <em>have</em> access to information doesn’t mean you see it. Sometimes 311 requests get ignored when an inspector can’t find the problem. With a bright pink arrow pointing to the truck tire, I figured they couldn’t miss it. (I’ve used this same approach with several requests, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://311.baltimorecity.gov/reports/17-00282034">a mattress on E. 27th Street</a>. The graphic is made with an app called Skitch.)</p>

<p>My 311 service requests are important to <em>me</em> but I know they are just a handful of the never-ending stream of service requests that city agencies recieve throughout the year. For example, in 2016, Harwood alone saw 1,720 requests to the Bureau of Solid Waste.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="charting-311-data-in-google-sheets">Charting 311 data in Google Sheets</h3>
<p>I pulled the 311 data for Harwood from the <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/311-Customer-Service-Requests-in-Harwood/3bb2-qqja">Open Baltimore data portal</a> into <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMYDzImLlnnX0-6ibHdD99-oT_0FFhleywyvlP2YK9Y/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets</a> where I could more easily do some basic analysis and share the results with my neighbors. One of the things I learned from this data is that my love for the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baltimore-311/id455865821?mt=8">311 iPhone app</a> makes me a bit of an outlier. Only a relatively small portion of 311 requests are submitted through the mobile apps. Most of the 311 requests in my neighborhood are submitted by phone.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-happens-after-you-call-311">What happens after you call 311?</h3>
<p>I also really wanted to know what happened to my 311 requests and how they compared to those of my neighbors. This complicated flow diagram (made using <a href="http://rawgraphs.io/">RAWGraphs</a> and <a href="https://vectr.com/">Vectr</a>) was my first attempt at following requests from submission to outcome – I’d love to see what other people can make of this data.</p>

<p>I knew we were having problems with dumping at Harwood Park but what about other parts of my neighborhood? I pulled my data from Google Sheets into <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a>, a free web-based GIS mapping tool, to make a heat map for hotspots of illegal dumping. I also solicited feedback from my neighbors on <a href="https://harwoodmd.nextdoor.com/">NextDoor</a>. I used the map and feedback from my neighbors to put together a short tour for Terrance Brown from the city’s <a href="http://publicworks.baltimorecity.gov/">Department of Public Works</a>.</p>

<p>My tour with DPW came after I had I’d submitted two 311 service requests for a pile of illegally dumped concrete debris on our playground. Both 311 requests were closed after DPW (or their contractors) removed some trash from the area but left the concrete. I emailed DPW for more information and scheduled the tour to discuss the issue. If we just looked at the data, it looks like we were getting good service in Harwood—but we weren’t yet. I decided to try to deal with the problem myself by piling the concerete into my old half-broken-down wheelbarrow and (with a little help from Donald at the Charles Village Community Benefits District) getting into a dumpster for the Mayor’s Spring Clean Up Day. Four large pieces remained up until late May!</p>

<p>Now I’m working around the corner on the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/elipousson/albums/72157682537798490">lot at Whitridge and Greenmount Avenue</a>. Strong City Baltimore has identified the poor condition as a barrier to the sale of the rehabbed houses on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhT7vCfAYQ8">Whitridge Row</a>. It is also unfortunate for people waiting for the bus on Greenount Avenue. While we can use data to argue for the importance of lot improvements, we can also put on some gloves and make a “data visualization” like this one: showing the amount of garbage one person can pick up on this lot in about fifteen minutes.</p>
</section>
<section id="making-data-open" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-data-open">Making data open</h3>
<p>I’ll wrap up by inviting everyone to try to explore how you can make data more open.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try setting up an account on Open Baltimore and creating a filtered view for your neighborhood. (See my <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H4BlwxFYcqvSwcggm8bUuCAPe7QdgL7BEfXrZN3TH_M/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">tutorial on using Open Baltimore</a> for tips.)</li>
<li>Next time you make a report: skip the PDF and just share a Google Spreadsheet. (I’ve set up Google Sheets with data on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNvFRqc6AqL-Fy-jXyerqzBIfzWRCbHDJg6qAchywdE/edit?usp=sharing">demolition permits</a> and citations for property owners who <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iM2QJwN1LUZ9LzP5lMxSp3VR2XjibF2wtoN8ldY9re8/edit?usp=sharing">failed to abate unsafe properties</a>.)</li>
<li>Don’t just record data, take photos and show your work along the way. (I stay motivated to address litter and dumping issues by sharing photos of litter on Instagram at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/riseandpickuplitter/">#riseandpickuplitter</a>)</li>
<li>Don’t just use data. Be part of making data!</li>
</ul>

  <title>Who remembers Baltimore’s Civil Rights heritage?</title>
  <dc:creator>Eli Pousson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-07-10-civil-rights-heritage/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>Our project on Baltimore’s Civil Rights Heritage is supported by the Maryland Historical Trust, the National Park Service, and PNC. This post is a draft of an essay recorded for <a href="https://www.wypr.org/post/baltimore-s-civil-rights-heritage">Humanities Connection on WYPR</a> in 2017.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-07-10-civil-rights-heritage/images/2016-04-06_union-baptist-church.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It is easy to forget that the Civil Rights movement did not begin in the basement of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church where Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp;and others organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955. It is easy to forget that the movement did not end in 1968 on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. It is easy to forget but, as Baltimore’s own Frederick Douglass reminded his audience in 1884:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It is not well to forget the past. Memory was given to man for some wise purpose. The past is the mirror in which we may discern the dim outlines of the future.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve kept his words in mind, as Baltimore Heritage and our partners documented the local history of the Civil Rights movement for the National Register of Historic Places. We’re looking at books, letters, and old photographs. But we’re also looking at the churches, homes, parks, and street corners where the history of the movement took place.</p>
<p>Today, Baltimore remembers Frederick Douglass with statues at Morgan State University and at a waterfront park at the western end of Thames Street. The Aliceanna Street house where Douglass lived before escaping from slavery in 1838 is gone. You can still visit the 500 block of South Dallas Street in Fell’s Point and see a group of rowhouses Douglass built in 1892.</p>
<p>People all around the country remember Douglass’ story. As a historian, I’m always grateful to people who remember.</p>
<p>Members of Union Baptist Church remember their former pastor Reverend Harvey Johnson and his wife Amelia E. Hall, an influential Afro-Canadian writer. In the 1880s, Johnson founded the Brotherhood of Liberty, one of the earliest Civil Rights groups in the nation. He fought for Civil Rights in the city’s courtrooms, writing: “there must be Negro lawyers, men who have themselves suffered and who will fight the people’s fight, because the people’s fight will be their own battle.” In 1905, Johnson built the sancturary for Union Baptist Church on Druid Hill Avenue where the congregation continues to worship today.</p>
<p>Long-time residents of Morgan Park in northeast Baltimore remember their former neighbor W.E.B. Du Bois. He visited Baltimore regularly in the early 1900s, seeking advice on organizing and activism from Rev.&nbsp;Johnson at Union Baptist. In 1905, Du Bois wrote: “We claim for ourselves every right that belongs to a freeborn American—political, civil and social—and until we get these rights, we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of America with the story of its shameful deeds toward us.” In 1939, Du Bois and his wife Nina built a house on Montebello Terrace in Morgan Park. After Nina’s death in 1950, DuBois split his time between Baltimore and New York before leaving the United States for Ghana in 1962.</p>
<p>Local politicians both black and white, remember Victorine Q. Adams. She started her work in politics in the 1940s. She established the Colored Women’s Democratic Campaign Committee to support politicians who opposed segregation and discrimination and the group, Woman Power, to get more black women involved in politics. At her home in Hanlon Park, Adams set up a voting machine and taught hundreds of black Baltimoreans how to vote for change. Finally, in 1968, Adams moved into a new office at Baltimore’s City Hall as the first black woman elected to the City Council.</p>
<p>Everyone in Baltimore remembers the 2015 protests at the Western District Police Station following Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Through our research, we’ve learned that activists have a long history at the Mount Street police station. Activists picketed outside to protest police violence in 1966, 1969, 1972, and 1980.</p>
<p>We want to know what you remember about Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement. Please read more about Baltimore’s Civil Rights movement and our project by visiting <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/">baltimoreheritage.org</a>.</p>

  <title>Researching Confederate monuments and Civil War memory at the Maryland Historical Society</title>
  <dc:creator>Eli Pousson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2017-05-24-lord-baltimore-fellowship/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A few weeks ago, I decided to apply for the Lord Baltimore Fellowship at the <a href="http://mdhs.org/">Maryland Historical Society</a> to continue the research I started in 2015 on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments and Civil War memory in Baltimore. This week, I heard the good news that the Maryland Historical Society accepted my application. This year-long fellowship is unpaid but comes with the exciting opportunity of “staff-level” access to the Society’s library and archives.</p>
<p>I began researching Confederate memory in June 2015 just a few days after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting">shooting in Charleston, South Carolina</a>. I created <a href="baltimoreheritage.github.io/places/timelines/civil-war-memory/">a simple timeline</a> on the history of Confederate monuments in Baltimore and published <a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/i-am-unwilling-to-see-erected-in-the-public-streets-of-this-city-a-monument-to-a-dead-idea/">a blog post</a> detailing the earliest local effort to erect a Confederate monument in 1880. That fall, I put together <a href="http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/confederate-memory/">a detailed report for Baltimore Heritage</a> and presented testimony before the <a href="http://baltimoreplanning.wix.com/monumentcommission">Special Commission to Review Baltimore’s Public Confederate Monuments</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, my own interest on this topic has a history of its’ own. A <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/project/lafayette-square-archeology/">July 2011 archaeological dig</a> to explore the Civil War camp and hospital at West Baltimore’s Lafayette Square and <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/tours/civil-war-150-west-baltimores-civil-war-history-by-bike/">a Civil War bike tour</a> in November led to a <a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/society-for-historical-archaeology-2012-interpreting-the-past-building-a-future-through-archaeology-in-lafayette-square/">presentation at the Society for Historical Archaeology</a> in January 2012 on the meaning of public archaeology and Civil War history in historically black neighborhoods. In November 2013, I put together a <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/tours/parks-preservation-emancipation-enjoy-three-new-walking-tours-around-mount-vernon-place-this-fall/">tour of Mount Vernon Place</a> on the histories of slavery and emancipation. You can find <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/tours/2015/11/07/mount-vernon-slavery-emancipation/">my rough notes for that tour</a> in the Baltimore Heritage open tour collection.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing all this back story? I think it is important for everyone, myself included, to think about how our knowledge of the past is built up over time. Our understanding of the past as individuals and communities is directly shaped by the politics of the places where we live and learn.</p>
<p>After the publication of the Special Commission’s <a href="http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ce643a_dec453d9aee640848c62dd23a3fb8764.pdf">final report</a> in September 2016 and the installation of new interpretive plaques at each of the Confederate monuments considered in the city’s review, there has been little public discussion around Baltimore’s Confederate monuments. Without funding or more active leadership by Baltimore’s Mayor or City Council, all four monuments seem likely to stay in place for the near future.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, however, the removal of four monuments associated with white supremacy and the Confederacy began <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/us/new-orleans-confederate-statue.html">in April</a> and ended on May 19, 2017. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu marked removal of the last of the four monuments with <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/mayor_landrieu_speech_confeder.html">a widely-circulated speech</a> explaining the city’s decision to take them down:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So relocating these Confederate monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, this is not about blame or retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once.</p>
<p>This is, however, about showing the whole world that we as a city and as a people are able to acknowledge, understand, reconcile and most importantly, choose a better future for ourselves making straight what has been crooked and making right what was wrong. Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price with discord, with division and yes with violence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel confident that Baltimore is not done talking about Confederate monuments and Civil War memory. Given the Maryland Historical Society’s own history in shaping local Civil War memory and importance role as a place where collections related to both the Civil War and the Civil Rights movement have found a home, the institution seems like the perfect place to take a closer look at these topics. If you’re interested, you can read my research proposal below. I’d love to hear your questions or suggestions for my research in the year ahead.</p>
<hr>
<p>Baltimore has a notable number of Confederate monuments for a city that remained with the Union throughout the Civil War. There are three Confederate monuments located in the city’s public parks and medians: the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (1903) on Mount Royal Avenue, the Confederate Women’s Monument (1917) on University Parkway, and the Lee-Jackson Monument (1948) located at Wyman Park Dell. A fourth statue on Mount Vernon Place—the Roger Brooke Taney Monument (1887)—memorializes a Maryland lawyer and Supreme Court Justice whose decision in the 1857 Dred Scott case earned him lasting infamy as an opponent of black freedom.</p>

<p>Many other monuments and statues have connections to Civil War memory—some obvious but others obscure. Thes include memorial statues to the Confederate dead in Loudon Park Cemetery; the enormous 1909 Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument relocated from Druid Hill Park to Wyman Park Dell in 1959; a 1911 monument to Confederate veteran John Mifflin Hood located at Preston Gardens since 1963; a 1919 statue of Confederate veteran and Baltimore Mayor Thomas G. Hayes at City Hall.</p>
<p>Reminders of Civil War memory are seen in the red and white symbol of the “Crossland Banner” in the Maryland State Flag (officially adopted in 1904) and heard in the state song, “Maryland, My Maryland” adopted in 1939. The Maryland Historical Society itself put on numerous exhibitions of Civil War art and artifacts over the institution’s history. In October 1947, the Maryland Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy worked with the Maryland Historical Society to open an exhibition of Confederate relics for students in Baltimore City public schools. In 1968, the addition of the Thomas and Hugg Building included a “Union Room” established to supplement the long-standing “Confederate Room”.</p>
<p>Although scholarly research on the Civil War in Maryland is extensive, histories of Civil War memory in Maryland are harder to find. Charles W. Mitchell covers the topic in the epilogue to his extensive compendium <em>Maryland Voices of the Civil War</em>. Other historians, notably &nbsp;David Blight in his influential 2002 study <em>Race and Reunion</em> or Paul Shackel in his 2003 book <em>Memory in Black and White</em>, have looked at the significant role of Civil War battlefields and related memorials as sites of conflict and reconciliation.</p>
<p>My own 2015 research on the history of Baltimore’s Confederate monuments has inspired my current interest in looking at the broader picture of Civil War memory in Baltimore and exploring how the monuments fit within a landscape of visual and literary culture created by Confederate and Union veterans, their descendants, and scholars who studied the Civil War from the nineteenth century up to the present. Within this landscape, the central importance of education, such as textbooks and approaches to teaching Civil War history, stands out as a subject that demands deeper consideration.</p>
<p>In addition, I’m interested in unpacking the largely obscure political dimensions of Civil War memory in Baltimore. For example, in 1887, Mayor Ferdinand Latrobe refused to appear at the dedication of the Taney Monument at Mount Vernon Place to protest the prominent speaking role granted to his political antagonist Severn Teackle Wallis. In 1948, the <em>Afro-American Newspaper</em> responded to Governor William Preston Lane Jr.’s remarks at the dedication of the Lee-Jackson Monument at Wyman Park Dell by challenging his support from the Southern Governors’ Association and their opposition to desegregation of public universities. In both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Confederate monuments cannot be separated from the politics of the people who supported their erection. I believe the enduring legacy of local expressions of Civil War memory cannot truly be understood or evaluated without putting the topic in conversation with the history of the politics surrounding race and Civil Rights movement.</p>
<p>Given the breadth of the Maryland Historical Society’s collections there are several potential directions for how I could use the available resources to further this research. Relevant materials include the papers of Confederate veterans like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalbert_J._Volck">Adalbert J. Volck</a> (MS 867); early historians of the Confederacy such as J. Thomas Scharf (MS 1999); institutions that served Confederate veterans directly such as the Confederate Maryland Line Beneficial Association (MS 255) and the Maryland Line Confederate Soldiers’ Home (PP159; MS 256); individuals who directly participated in the creation and dedication of Confederate monuments such as Colonel Benjamin Franklin Taylor (MS 1863). Additional context on the process of commissioning of public artwork during the early twentieth century might be found in the records of the Municipal Arts Society (MS 2875). One of the most significant collections available for this research is the records of the United Daughters of the Confederacy covering the period from 1936 to 1984 (MS 2846). The availability of records from the 1960s and 1970s suggests the possibility of learning more about the group’s reaction to such efforts as the creation of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture (MCAAHC) in 1969 or the Negro Soldier Monument originally located next to the Battle Monument in 1972.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this effort, however, is not just to satisfy my curiosity with a detailed scholarly study or unearth forgotten records from the archives. Instead, I hope to explore new ways to make Civil War memory relevant and meaningful to Baltimore residents in the present. I’m especially interested in how to make the topic relevant to young people; a goal that, perhaps ironically, many “Lost Cause” historians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century shared.</p>
<p>Connecting African American audiences with Civil War history has been a challenge for many contemporary public historians. Writer and Baltimore native Ta-Nehisi Coates reflected in <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143291199/black-scholar-of-the-civil-war-asks-whos-with-me">a 2011 NPR interview</a> on how African Americans have been excluded from the interpretation of the Civil War through “Lost Cause” mythologies. Coates remarked that, “one of the most depressing things [he] found,” was when a tour guide at the Gettysburg Battlefield park told him, “‘You can sit there for hours — and you can count on one hand the number of African-Americans that come into the battle park.’” In a 2012 article for The Atlantic magazine, Coates describes how the “country’s battlefields are marked with the enduring evidence” of the “tireless efforts” by Confederate descendants to present their own story of the Civil War—a story that, despite their defeat in the conflict, erased their ancestors complicity with the system of slavery that Confederate troops had fought for and died trying to preserve.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Charleston church shooting pushed the topic of Confederate memory to the front of public debates in a new way. The often contentious debates that followed have made it difficult to ignore the continued political significance of Civil War memory as an issue. With this study, I hope to find ways of using the history of Civil War memory to support constructive conversations on the relationship between memorials and politics in the past and in the future.</p>

  <title>How to plan a good walking tour</title>

<p>I met with a colleague over coffee at the new <a href="https://redemmas.org/gcl">Greenmount Coffee Lab</a> to share advice on organizing a two hour walking tour program later this spring. When I got back to my desk, I thought the advice might be worth writing up into a quick tutorial.</p>
<p>In my experience, it takes about five hours to plan a two-hour-long walking tour program. It may take you more or less time depending on your background and how you approach the tour. The process I use works best for guided walking tours where you already have information about most or all of the tour sites. If you are planning a guided bike tours or bus tours or any self-guided tour, you may need to tweak this approach. If you are just getting started and do not know what tour sites might be appropriate to visit, you may need to <a href="https://baltimoreheritage.org/resources/research-guide/">do more research</a> before you plan your walking tour.</p>

<p>I spent a week in Philadelphia last month participating in a&nbsp;training on&nbsp;Historic Real Estate Finance&nbsp;from&nbsp;the National Development Council. The five-day course&nbsp;-&nbsp;organized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation with support from the 1776 Foundation - gave me&nbsp;an expanded understanding of how redevelopment projects are supported through a range of private&nbsp;and&nbsp;public investments.</p>
<p>One highlight of the week was a&nbsp;tour of the University City neighborhood (organized by Melissa Jest from the National Trust and led by local resident/developer Ryan Spack) where we learned about the reuse of a former bank building on Baltimore Avenue as the <a href="https://www.mariposa.coop">Mariposa Food Co-op</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.universitycity.org/project-rehab">Project Rehab program</a> of the&nbsp;University City District. We also got to peek inside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Furness">Frank Furness</a> designed former Saint Peter’s Church of Christ - a building that was <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/property/2015/04/15/frank-furness-church-philadelphia-preschools-conversion/">narrowly saved from demolition</a> early this year.</p>
<p>I uploaded <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/elipousson/sets/72157655593211419">a set of photographs</a> from the training and tour to Flickr and included a few favorites below.</p>

  <title>“I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea”</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>As Baltimore begins a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-confederate-statues-20150630-story.html">review of the city’s Confederate monuments</a>, I’ve been doing some research on the history of these monuments trying to understand the city in which the monuments were originally erected. I was excited to find a “sensible letter” from Charles T. Crane to then Baltimore Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Claiborne_Latrobe">Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe</a>, published on March 27, 1880. I was surprised to find that Crane, a Confederate veteran, strongly disavowed the principle behind the recent rebellion and efforts to memorialize the Confederacy, writing: “I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea.”</p>
<p>Who supported the effort to erect this Confederate memorial? What moved Crane to write to the mayor? How can we understand this unusual document today?</p>

<p>On January 19, 1880, at the annual meeting of the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States in Maryland, a group of Confederate veterans passed a series of resolutions organizing a committee to “secure funds for the purpose of erecting a monument in the city of Baltimore to the memory of Marylanders who died in the service of the Confederate States.” The group worked quickly and, on March 24, the first branch of the Baltimore City Council passed a resolution permitting the Society to “erect a monument on Eutaw Place, near Lanvale st.” Three days later, Crane’s letter appeared in <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In connection with the subject of a proposed Confederate monument in one of the public squares of Baltimore, Mr.&nbsp;Charles T. Crane, a soldier of the late Confederate army, has written the following sensible letter to Mayor Latrobe, which, it will be seen, is in accord with the views of The Sun, as given yesterday:</p>
<p>“Hon.&nbsp;F.C. Latrobe.—My Dear Sir. I do not believe that any one who knows me will question my devotion to the cause of the late Confederate States of America. It is with this belief that I venture to address you in opposition to the proposed Confederate monument in this city. I consider the erection of such a monument in the streets of Baltimore impolitic, inexpedient, and injudicious in the highest degree. <strong>Whatever the sentiments and sympathies of the people of Maryland may have been or may be now, there was and there is a very respectable minority of them who did not sympathize with the South during the civil war.</strong> Whatever may have been the agencies employed to accomplish such result, the fact remains that Maryland did not leave the Union, and while hundreds of her sons gave up their lives in defense of the South, the State itself was never a member of the Confederacy. I yield to no one in honoring the memories of those noble spirits who devotion to principle led them to abandon friends and home to die for what they conceived to be right.</p>
<p>We have two beautiful monuments erected to their memories in that hallowed city of the dead –Loudon Park. In my humble judgement this and kindred spots are the only fitting places on Maryland soil for the erection of Confederate monuments, because, whatever it may cost us to make the acknowledgement, however painful it may be to realize the fact, the truth is undeniable that the cause for which they fought is <em>dead.</em> The principles of civil liberty, of State’s rights and of local self-government may live, nay, do live and burn in thousands of manly bosoms, but the <em>cause</em>, <em>a separate national existence</em> for the States and people of the South is _dead—__forever dead_.</p>
<p>This being my belief, I, for one, am prepared to accept the situation, and without the least abandonment of principle, without sacrifice of honor, with a heart full of love and reverence for my fallen comrades, <strong>I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea, but which will be a standing menace, and a source of bitterness</strong> not only to a great number of the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland, but to a great number of the people of the United States. The war is over. For God’s sake let us of the South do nothing to revive its enmities and hates, but rather cultivate a spirit of reconciliation and peace. We are one people, let us be one in spirit as well as in name.</p>
<p>I know that these views are opposed to some of my nearest and dearest friends, some of whom may be disposed to judge harshly my attitude in this matter. For this I am prepared. I believe I am right, and <strong>what is thought of me is of small consequence compared to the evils which I believe will follow the erection of the proposed monument</strong>.</p>
<p>I am, dear sir, yours very truly,</p>
<p>Chas. T. Crane</p>
<p>Baltimore, March 26, 1880.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Just days after the letter was published, the issue arrived before the Second Branch of the Baltimore City Council. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jwhIAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;ots=L3FVU5CEGf&amp;dq=dr.%20thom%20baltimore%20doctor%20civil%20war%20city%20council&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Dr.&nbsp;J. Pembroke Thom</a>, a member of the Council and also a Confederate veteran, opposed the proposed monument and presented into the record a memorial (meaning a letter, a memo) of “residents on Eutaw Square and vicinity and elsewhere, against allowing the erection of a Confederate monument on the square.” The letter from local residents, “expressed respect from the memory of the gallant dead, but opposed the movement as calculated to disturb harmony and good feeling between citizens of all shades of opinion.” In addition, the Council received printed memorials “with several hundred signatures of officers and soldiers who served in the Union army and others, in opposition to allowing the erection of the proposed Confederate monument in Eutaw Square.”</p>
<p>Despite this opposition, on March 31, 1880, the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States in Maryland succeeded in pushing the second branch of the Baltimore City Council to approve the resolution and send it along to Mayor Latrobe.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1880, the Mayor returned the resolution to the first branch of the City Council - “without his approval” - writing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“During the late civil war the people of Baltimore were divided in sentiment and action on the questions which, after a prolonged and embittered struggle, were finally decided by the sword. The ardor, bravery and devotion to principle of the Maryland soldiers, and the honor due to the memory of those who fell upon the battle-field is universally acknowledged. But <strong>while the issues involved in the war have been settled by its result, in most cases the convictions of those who as actors or sympathizers took part in the contest continue to exist</strong>. Under these circumstances the erection at this time in one of the public squares of <strong>a memorial monument commemorative of the acts of those who fought upon either side would not fail to be repugnant to the opinions and sentiments of very many people</strong>. The public highways and squares of the city are the common property of all, and we who are temporarily entrusted with their control, whatever our personal opinions may be, are not, in my judgment, justified in dedicating any portion of them to a purpose which would be in direct opposition to the sensibilities and wishes of large numbers of citizens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effort to build a monument on Eutaw Street evidently ended with Mayor Latrobe’s veto but Confederate veteran groups in Baltimore persisted.</p>

<p>Seven years later, the city saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Taney_(sculpture)">erection of a statue</a> honoring Supreme Court Justice Roger B. Taney (donated by William Walters) in the north square of Mount Vernon Place. In February 1903, the “Spirit of the Confederacy” was dedicated at Mount Royal Terrace. In 1917, the Confederate Women’s Monument was erected at Charles Street and University Parkway. In 1948, the Robert E. Lee-Stonewall Jackson Monument was dedicated on Wyman Park Drive across from the Baltimore Museum of Art. For over 70 years, this persistent commemorative agenda closely paralleled efforts to segregate, disenfranchise, and discriminate against African-Americans in Baltimore and Maryland.</p>

<p>It is striking that even opponents of the 1880 effort — Charles T. Crane, Dr.&nbsp;J. Pembroke Thom, and Ferdinand Latrobe — presented&nbsp;the Civil War as “settled.” They gave&nbsp;little consideration for how the nearly 54,000 African-Americans living in Baltimore at the time may have viewed the memorial. To understand the difficult history and significance of these monuments today, we must continue to expand this story beyond Crane’s letter. We must listen to the voices of the black Baltimoreans who stood witness to the erection of Confederate memorials in 1887, 1903, 1917, and 1948, and have experienced the consequences of these symbols in the city’s landscape up through the present.</p>

<p>I’ve been driving up and down Harford Road pretty regularly over the past few weeks for our work on the <a href="http://baltimoreheritage.org/project/herring-run-park-archeology/">Herring Run Archaeology project</a>. Each time I return back down to Mount Vernon, this midcentury bank building at 2056 Harford Road just called out to me. Knowing nothing about the building, I went looking for some more details.</p>
<p>A quick search turned up a <a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=629"><em>Baltimore Sun</em> account</a> from September 4, 1956 - Branch Bank To Be Marked By New Look - turned up some key details on this former branch location for the Union Trust Bank:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A long-range program of modernization has resulted in the construction of eight new, modern bank buildings to replace old structures, plus extensive remodeling and enlargement of five additional branch offices in a ten-year period. There are now 25 Union Trust banking offices scattered through the Baltimore area. […] <strong>Designed by Smith &amp; Veale</strong>, local architects, the new building is to give the conception of a glass box. The steel frame is exposed and treated as part of the architecture of the building. Masonry masses are utilized to conceal the vault and other security facilities of the branch. […] Ample hard-surfaced parking area on the rear of the lot is afforded for walk-in customers. A drive-up window beneath a canopy is available along the side of the building.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The firm of Smith &amp; Veale was a partnership of local architects Thomas W. Smith and Graham Veale established shortly after the end of World War II. The firm designed scores of modern banks, libraries and schools. Veale, who <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-01-19/news/1996019074_1_bethlehem-steel-owings-mills-mary-joan">passed away in 1996</a> at the age of 91, was a Philadelphia native who came to Baltimore as a teenager. Smith <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-05/news/1998248050_1_gladys-mitchell-anne-county-sparks">died in 1998</a> at the age of 89. I recently profiled two other buildings designed by the firm - the <a href="http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/494">KAGRO Building</a> on North Avenue and the <a href="http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/495">North Point Branch</a> of the Baltimore County Public Library - as part of a nascent effort to expand our coverage of modernism in Explore Baltimore Heritage. I’d love to located the eight new Union Trust bank branches mentioned above and add them to our growing collection. If you’re interested in modernist architecture in Baltimore, please join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/712305302197735/">Baltimore Modernism Project</a> Facebook group to share ideas, research and writing on this theme.</p>
<p>The striking combination of the midcentury sign board and the cantilevered canopy above the bank’s drive-through window was regrettably demolished in the fall of 2013 - not long after the deteriorated condition of the building was highlighted with a public artwork by <a href="https://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/2058-2056-harford-road/">Wall Hunters Mural project</a>. The bank building remains vacant.</p>

  <title>We have a problem with vacant houses in Baltimore. Part two of two.</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This is Part Two of my paper for the Vernacular Architecture Forum Conference in Chicago. <a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-one-of-a-draft-paper-for-the-vaf-conference-in-chicago/">Part one is located here</a>. This particular section is&nbsp;adapted from <a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/each-vacant-house-is-a-standing-menace-to-the-rest/" title="“Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest.”">another post</a> I published last summer.</em></p>
<p>A final example from 1910 illustrates the difficulty that many residents and elected official experienced in trying to come to terms with the causes of vacant &nbsp;houses. Some observers clearly saw how suburban growth at the periphery and disinvestment from the core drove Baltimore’s emerging vacant house problem. However, then and perhaps now, anxiety over high property taxes, worries over diminished property values and white supremacy largely defined the terms of the debate. Rather than challenge the enormous public subsidies for suburban growth or encourage more substantial investment in the maintenance of older city neighborhoods (by then occupied largely by recent immigrants and African Americans), the city instead fought vacancy by writing racism into local housing laws.</p>
<p>In August 1910, a member of the real estate firm of William Martien &amp; Company who shared a growing “agitation over the number of vacant houses in the city,” asked the Baltimore Police board to undertake a “complete census of the number of houses, both vacant and occupied in the city.” With the release of the report, real estate agent James Cary Martien argued, “The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore.”</p>
<p>Martien’s focus on housing supply and demand neglected to account for the intense concern that many Baltimoreans had with racial segregation - advancing the necessity of segregation on the principle of white supremacy and the economic logic of preserving property values. In the weeks that followed the publication of the report, a series of letters to the Sun expanded on Martien’s summary and tied vacancy closely to the perceived threat of “negro invasion.”</p>
<p>For example, when some residents argued that high taxes contributed to housing abandonment, one northwest Baltimore resident wrote back under the name “Pure White” arguing that the “negro neighbor is the main reason.” The letter, published on August 27, 1910, continued:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When a man works and saves and buys a home thinking it will be his shelter in his old age, and wakes up some morning to find he has a negro neighbor, he feels hurt and aggrieved that he has to give up his home, but he moves. […] I know of three families who want to buy a home this fall and they prefer the city to the suburbs, but they are hesitating because of this disagreeable possibility. […] <strong>The real estate men—a few of them, not all—are to blame for the vacant houses and with them, lies the remedy.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 2, 1910, a letter signed by “Justice” echoed this sentiment and with a demand that the city to protect his neighborhood from “invasion” and vacant houses writing:</p>
<p>“There are several vacant houses in the block, and this fear may be the potent cause of non-rental or sale. Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest. We live in daily dread that we may be driven out and forced to sell at a depreciated price if we can sell at all.”</p>
<p>A third resident, writing on September 15, 1910, framed the issue as clearly distinct from the seasonal vacancy of the past several decades or vacancy created by the passing uncertainty of a transitioning neighborhood:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The vacant house problem in the city should be one of grave concern at this time to our municipal administrators, to our real estate agents and to those having the welfare of the city at heart. <strong>It is not a temporary but a growing evil</strong> that is confronting and threatening every owner of property. The number of vacant houses has grown and grown until at last there is <strong>common alarm in the matter</strong>, and justly so. What then are the causes producing this condition? There are many, but the fundamental one is purely economic—high taxes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Residents like “Pure White” and “Justice” won a victory on December 20, 1910, when Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West who represented the northwestern neighborhood highlighted in the police report for the highest concentration of vacant houses.</p>
<p>The new law was the first local ordinance in the country to enforce racial segregation in housing as it forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” Each block was designated according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910 and the city police were tasked with enforcing the new policy.</p>
<p>While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, it was followed by several more &nbsp;attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation. Often overlooked in this much-discussed chapter of Baltimore’s history of segregation, vacant housing played a critical role in stoking white&nbsp;fears and reinforcing a racialized perception of “blight” in the decades that followed.</p>
<p>The effort to promote racial segregation ultimately did little to address the structural issues around taxes and infrastructure costs that continued to promote disinvestment up until the beginning of WWI. This period also saw the emerging concern with the visibility of vacant houses as a symbol of the city’s perceived decline. &nbsp;One letter, published on on March 5, 1912 and signed by “Belle Baltimore,” decried the sight of vacant houses as the city prepared to celebrate the Centennial of the Battle of Baltimore in 1914:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“While we are cleaning house to welcome visitors to Baltimore in June, there is one very offensive spectacle we should strive to remove. It is the sight of so many residences on our best avenues, vacant, dead and decaying houses, with staring, grimy windows covered with signs ‘For Rent’ or ‘For Sale,’ like ghastly invitations to a funeral.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Belle Baltimore” continued to complain about burdensome taxes required to support the investment in the suburban Annex where &nbsp;“speculative builders” erected “row of these sardine boxes” that make Baltimore “more and more like a model workhouse or prison every year.” The letter concludes with a tone of finality:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“To escape unjust taxation people of means are taking refuge in apartments or in the suburbs…. Does not this state of things savor a little of the knights of the road, who became popular heroes by ‘robbing the rich to serve the poor?’ One thing is certain: Well-to-do people will shun cities infested by such gentry. Because of it Baltimore is already like a tree rotten at the core.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1914, with the start of World War II, debates over vacant housing retreated as the home building industry ground to near complete halt. Construction permits for new dwellings in Baltimore dwindled from 2,484 in 1916, to 885 in 1917, and just 378 in 1918. During World War II, concern over blight often focused on housing “congestion” rather than vacancy, although clearly the issue remained present. After World War II, and throughout the period of urban renewal into the 1970s, the predecessors of today’s vacant house policies took shape. Over the past few decades, the&nbsp;scale and scope of issues around&nbsp;vacant houses&nbsp;has continued to grow.</p>

<p>Today, advocates for historic preservation and community development struggle to secure public support for substantial reinvestment in historic urban cores. Legacy city leaders from Detroit to Cleveland to Baltimore have retreated from what seemed to be an unattainable agenda&nbsp;of regional governance and adequate&nbsp;funding for affordable housing. Instead, we see strategic demolition and “blight elimination” championed as a short-term necessity in neighborhoods like Sandtown Winchester.</p>
<p>Just as the city experienced&nbsp;a century ago, many people&nbsp;want to define the city’s challenges as a “vacant house problem” - locating the issue&nbsp;in low-income African American communities alone. This definition places the sole responsibility to solve to problem on those residents, rather than acknowledging the complicity of Baltimore’s broader system of spatial inequality. Let’s work to make sure the next century offers a new definition of the “vacant house problem” and a new set of solutions.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><em>This post is the first half&nbsp;of a&nbsp;paper I am working on for the 2015 Vernacular Architecture Forum conference&nbsp;in Chicago this June. The paper focuses on the history of vacant housing&nbsp;and demolition from the mid 19th to early 20th century. This is a draft so I’d welcome any initial thoughts, questions or&nbsp;suggestions.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We have a problem with vacant houses in Baltimore. A vacant might be a bank-owned brick townhouse from the 1970s; a narrow two-story rowhouse built for working-class whites in the 1910s; or a four-story 1870s mansion half-collapsed into the basement. Baltimore City estimates the city holds around 16,000 vacant properties – mostly attached rowhouses built before WWII.</p>
<p>Visitors to Baltimore won’t find vacant houses in every neighborhood. In the largely white area of Hampden, Remington and Medfield, the vacancy rate is less than 1% – around sixty houses. In the West Baltimore neighborhoods of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park, over one-third of residential properties are vacant – totalling more than 2,000 vacant buildings.</p>
<p>It was in Sandtown on April 12 where a group of Baltimore police officers arrested Freddie Gray. A week later, Gray’s death from injuries he suffered in police custody sparked huge protests against police violence. Some residents marched and organized, others attacked local storefronts and burned police cars, prompting the city and state to bring in National Guard troops and impose a citywide curfew. Journalists from across the nation descended on Baltimore to write about the so-called “riots” and to ask the question: what’s the problem with Baltimore? How did the city get to be so poor, so violent and so segregated? Why does Baltimore have so many vacant houses?</p>
<p>Despite the confident explanations offered in newspaper editorials and television reports, over the past few weeks, these are not easy questions to answer. Even when people in Baltimore try to explain our “vacant house problem,” the responses often are incomplete at best and misleading at worst.</p>
<p>A professor at Johns Hopkins University might highlight Bethlehem Steel’s $1.5 billion loss in 1982 – a watershed in the city’s loss of good jobs to neoliberalism and globalization.</p>
<p>A neighborhood activist in Druid Heights might point back to the unrest that rocked the city after the 1968 assassination of Dr.&nbsp;Martin Luther King, leaving vacant lots and vacant buildings that have never recovered.</p>
<p>A retiree living in Columbia who grew up shopping at downtown department stories may sadly recall when O’Neil’s Department Store closed the day after Christmas in 1955.</p>
<p>An amateur urban planner on Facebook might talk about how the city’s population peaked around 1 million in 1950 before falling more than a third to 620,961 in 2010.</p>
<p>Limited as they are, each of these stories has the power to shape policy around vacant housing. Do we invest in tearing vacant houses down or fixing them up? Can demolition solve Baltimore’s vacant house problem? Can historic preservation?</p>
<p>A recent Blight as Politics Symposium at the University of Michigan articulated the urgency of questioning narrowly framed, just-so stories of the urban crisis:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“With a few signal exceptions, discussions of ‘blight’ have proceeded in dehistoricized and depoliticized contexts oriented around narrow technical parameters, as if ‘blight’ was an easily defined and objective phenomenon instead of the spatial residue of racism and segregation, deindustrialization, disinvestment, and other fraught dynamics of American urban history.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baltimore’s vacant houses – an iconic symbol of the city’s poverty, violence and desolation – first appeared before 1982, before 1968, and before 1950. As early as 1880, the Baltimore City Police Department was trying to monitor and mitigate the problems of vacant houses in the city’s wealthy suburbs. In 1910, observers in Baltimore called vacant houses “a growing evil,” the source of “common alarm.” In 1932, one prominent local architect declared that the rowhouse had no potential for “modern and reasonably attractive” use; Baltimore’s “dying areas” were forced into a “hopeless future competition” with the suburbs.</p>
<p>The foundation of Baltimore’s current debate over what to do about vacant houses in Sandtown-Winchester has been laid down over the course of a century or more. The debate is framed by a long history of salvage and demolition, stories about the places we choose to forget, to tear down, and to salvage instead of save. In this way, we can read the history of vacants – how we describe them and what we do about them – as an alternate history of historic preservation itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Concerns over population loss and vacant housing in Baltimore date back nearly two centuries. Writing in 1831, publisher Hezekiah Niles reflected on the city’s population loss during the economic crisis of the early 1820s, recalling how “because of the want of employment in those years, [there was a] consequent removal of the people, to the north, south, east and west.” The city had recovered from the severe depression and Niles could then boast that, “There is hardly a house unoccupied, though a very large number was built the last season.”</p>

<p>With capital from men like Hezekiah Niles, as well as the labor from thousands of recent immigrants, enslaved and free blacks, Baltimore grew quickly. The city more than doubled in population between 1830 and 1850. Growth came with new patterns of land use around Baltimore’s downtown. Property-owners tore down hundreds of old homes to make way for new warehouses and commercial buildings.</p>
<p>In May 1847, the National Intelligencer on a rare demolition “deemed worthy of notice,” wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“workmen are now engaged tearing down the very oldest house in Baltimore; to erect in its stead an elegant new warehouse. […] Daguerreotype sketches and other drawings were taken of it, to preserve as relics, prior to its demolition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later example, from January 1891, locals gathered at the scene of the demolition of a former suburban mansion overwhelmed by the city built up around it with a plan to take more than drawings. As the crowd watched the “quaint but pretentious little building of classic architecture” disappear “before the march of modern improvement” they “eagerly gathered “pieces of its mantel-pieces and bits of its woodwork […] for souvenirs.” The home, known as Tusculum, was fondly remembered as the host of a vibrant arts and poetry society in the early 1800s. Despite the building’s neglect, it was still occupied by a “family of colored people” who “made the noted Tusculum their home” but likely had little power to protest their eviction.</p>

</div>
<p>After demolition, the elements of an abandoned building could be turned into mementoes or into the very source of subsistence and survival. The hard times that Hezekiah Niles witnessed in the early 1820s returned again in wake of the Panic of 1893. In February 1895, the Sun reported how:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The demolition of the Old City College building on North Howard street was eagerly watched all day yesterday by a crowd of persons armed with baskets or bags, and anxious to pick from the ruins some bits of wood to add to their scanty store of fuel at home.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps some among the crowd took shelter in the city’s vacant houses. In the 1880s, many impoverished travelers - “tramps” - had been found “sleeping in the brick and limekilns of South and Southwest Baltimore.” A white person with no home could find a place to spend the night at a police station house, but as the Sun observed in 1888:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A notable fact is the small number of colored tramps who call at the station-houses. This is not because there are no colored tramps, but because they are generally badly treated by their white brethren when lodging together.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidence for the growing availability of vacant houses in the city can be found in an October 1898 account which observed defensively:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Other cities have endeavored to make capital of reports of the very large number of vacant houses in Baltimore, claiming it as an evidence that this city is falling behind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The account continues to highlight a strong resurgence in home building - but, as the next decade illustrated, strong growth could paradoxically increase vacant housing. This combination of growth and inequality shaped a new response to vacant housing from metal thieves and the city police.</p>
<hr>
<p>Between 1850 and 1880, the city’s population doubled again and new buildings had sprawled over the city limits and into “the Belt” - an area built up with factories and clusters of suburban cottages that surrounded the city to the east, west and north. Throughout this period, inadequate sewers and frequent outbreaks of disease encouraged many well-off residents to leave their homes every summer.</p>

Weishampel. [JScholarship](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/36534).</a>]</p>
<p>Seasonal vacancy illustrates the challenge of defining what makes a vacant house. Whether a property owner leaves their house unoccupied for a month or a year, when does it become vacant? The persistence and scale of seasonal vacancy between the 1860s and early 1900s, left many homes at risk of an illicit form of salvage and demolition - metal theft - and placed a new burden on Baltimore city and county police officers to protect the Baltimore’s vacant homes on behalf of their absent owners.</p>
<p>An typical example of metal theft at a vacant house appeared in March 1868 describing how thieves in the night “carried off, undetected, two chandeliers and six brackets valued at $125” from a vacant dwelling at 659 West Lombard Street. In 1877, the Sun described how a suburban home in northwest Baltimore standing “vacant for some months” was “entered by vandals and despoiled of nearly all its detachable metal fittings,” adding that “Residents of the belt complain that depredations of this kind are frequent.” In 1887, two men were arrested for taking “copper lining in bath-tubs, gas brackets, globes and lead pipe” from “unoccupied houses in the neighborhood of Lexington street and Fulton avenue.”</p>
<p>The police response to these threats was creative. In 1877, the officer encouraged property-owners cut “peep-holes” in their back fences “at convenient points for observation, through which the officers can have a full view of the rear of the premises without climbing over.”</p>
<p>In August 1881, the police asked local families to report their travel plans to local authorities creating what is likely the city’s earliest formal inventory of vacant buildings, as the Sun reported:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This summer the exodus from Baltimore has been greater than usual, and there are probably some twelve or thirteen hundred houses vacant, mainly in the north and northwestern sections of the city. The protection of this property is left to the police, and how to preserve it intact has been a matter of careful consideration by the police authorities. Notifications that the families have removed are generally sent to Police Marshal Gray or to the captains of districts with requests that the houses be looked after.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1897, concern over “Vacant House Robberies” led Baltimore police officers to patrol in “citizen dress” to try to catch thieves in the act. Baltimore Police Captain Solomon Freeburger offered a number of creative ideas as a solution including a plan to place younger officers in the neighborhoods with the greatest number of vacant homes, noting:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In the residential parts of the city where there are great numbers of vacant houses, it would be well to place the young men who are active and alert. Daily inspection of all property left for the summer is practiced at present in this city.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freeburger even recommended electric burglar alarms calling them an “almost a perfect guarantee of a thief’s apprehension, or, at least, that he will be frightened off before accomplishing robbery.”</p>
<p>Metal theft is one of the earliest local examples of illicit and criminal activity that concentrated on vacant houses but it is far from the last. &nbsp;In the 1910s and 1920s, police raided illegal stills and gambling halls in vacant houses. In the 1930s, officers made&nbsp;mass arrests&nbsp;of “vagrants,” people left homeless and unemployed by the Great Depression,&nbsp;who took shelter in the growing number of abandoned homes. In this way, vacant houses became more than just unoccupied buildings&nbsp;- they became seen a threat to public order that required an aggressive response by the police and public policy.</p>

  <title>Before Freddie Gray: “The Police Board… made an order forbidding public parades”</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Yesterday, thousands of people&nbsp;assembled in downtown Baltimore to protest the death of Freddie Gray. Despite a largely peaceful assembly,&nbsp;media coverage of the protests has focused on the handful of vehicles&nbsp;and storefronts damaged during the day. This morning, I appreciated activist Deray McKesson’s reflections on troubling issues with the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/deray/status/592289538715811840">coverage of the protest</a>&nbsp; and the&nbsp;false equivalency between&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/deray/status/592282869692813312">property damage and violence</a>.&nbsp;While researching the&nbsp;<a href="https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/04/24/before-freddie-gray-a-history-of-police-violence-in-baltimore/" title="Before Freddie Gray: A History of Police Violence in Baltimore">history of police violence in Baltimore</a>, I&nbsp;came across an early example&nbsp;of the police&nbsp;response to a black public assembly that I’d like to juxtapose&nbsp;with yesterday’s events.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-04-26-before-freddie-gray-the-police-board-made-an-order-forbidding-public-parades/images/ourpolicehistory00fols_0131-1600.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">John T. Gray from <a href="https://archive.org/stream/ourpolicehistory00fols#page/111/mode/1up">“Our police” (1888)</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The&nbsp;account of this police response,&nbsp;published&nbsp;in 1883,&nbsp;describes&nbsp;how the Baltimore Police Marshal John T. Gray “took every precaution for the prevention of an outbreak” of violence during a celebratory parade and political rally that followed the adoption of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>&nbsp;in 1870. It continues to share&nbsp;how black men in Baltimore organized&nbsp;“dozens of military companies,” armed with “old army muskets” and drilled on&nbsp;Baltimore’s streets. After&nbsp;the shooting young man by members of one of these regiments,&nbsp;Marshal John T. Gray&nbsp;attacks one of the companies&nbsp;(unclear if it was the same group&nbsp;implicated in the shooting),&nbsp;arrests their officers, and disarms the men.</p>
<p>It is hard to interpret&nbsp;this account from our contemporary perspective. I haven’t been able&nbsp;to fully corroborate&nbsp;this account&nbsp;in the <em>Baltimore Sun,</em>&nbsp;but if we accept this account as accurate it is important to note that the Baltimore police didn’t&nbsp;respond to the shooting by attempting&nbsp;arrest the individuals directly involved. Instead, the Baltimore&nbsp;Police Board “made an order forbidding public parades” and Police Marshal Gray targeted the <em>most prominent</em>&nbsp;company of black troops - the “crack” Lincoln Guard.&nbsp;By disarming and dismantling these organizations,&nbsp;the Baltimore police eliminated an important vehicle&nbsp;for black Baltimoreans to mobilize Republican voters and defend themselves against violence.</p>
<p>To be clear:&nbsp;I’m not arguing that the actions of the Baltimore police in 2015 are equivalent to the&nbsp;actions of the police in 1871. I’m not trying to suggest that the Lincoln Guard are the same as the protestors here today. However, the story contains important&nbsp;elements–elite&nbsp;fear of black public assembly, racist images&nbsp;of black political action, and&nbsp;the role&nbsp;of the police in protecting&nbsp;an ambiguous public interest–that suggest an important continuity between Baltimore in the 1870s and today.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;November 1, 1870, the&nbsp;<em>Baltimore Sun</em>,&nbsp;then strongly&nbsp;opposed to the Republican party and black suffrage, reported on a Democratic political&nbsp;rally where the&nbsp;images&nbsp;of&nbsp;black men armed with bayonets&nbsp;and black elected officials depicted as criminals were&nbsp;prominently displayed:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A grand demonstration of the democratic conservative party, comprising an immense and brilliant procession, with torches, banners and devices, and an overwhelming mass meeting in Monument Square, took place last night upon the call of the democratic executive committee of the city.&nbsp;[…]</p>
<p>Thirteenth Ward–James Cosgove, chief marshal.–The display in this ward was good though in point of number not so large. A wagon, drawn by four horses, contained a monument, upon the front of which was a life-size portrait of Washington. […] There was a <strong>representation of a company of colored men pointing their bayonets</strong> at the place of holding the polls, with the inscription, “What free American has come to under radical rule.” There was also a <strong>picture of</strong> <strong>a man in the act of stealing spoons, with inscription as to type of the radical Congress</strong>, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same rally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Swann">Thomas Swann</a>, the immediate past Governor of Maryland and a&nbsp;member of the U.S. House of&nbsp;Representatives,&nbsp;shared his own&nbsp;comments on the&nbsp;threat of organized black voters:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Creswell">[General Creswell]</a> had come here to [Baltimore] to marshal his negro crowd of voters, and to attempt to overawe the democracy with threats of what the President would do with his soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baltimore’s newly enfranchised black citizens, including many veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops, could clearly see&nbsp;this procession and assembly as a serious threat to their own hard-won rights. But the police, of course, did not shut down Democratic rallies or parades.&nbsp;And in January 1870&nbsp;the Democratic party (and the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>) opposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Act_of_1871_(third_act)">Enforcement Act of 1871</a>&nbsp;empowering&nbsp;President Ulysses S. Grant to suspend the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>&nbsp;in trying to end the terrorism of the&nbsp;Ku Klux Klan (KKK).</p>
<p>This history can help us think about what we will fight for and what we won’t. Here is the account for your consideration:</p>
<hr>
<p>As Marshal of Baltimore Mr.&nbsp;Gray achieved a national reputation by the reforms he instituted and by the skill with which lie handled his force on many critical occasions. The great Emancipation Jubilee of the negroes in 1870 was the first serious occasion upon which Marshal Gray’s skill as a policeman showed itself prominently.&nbsp;This was the&nbsp;celebration by the negroes of their emancipation. In Baltimore, as well as in all the other Southern cities, certain classes of the white population still harbored a bitter feeling against the negroes, intensified by the offensive manner in which many of the latter had conducted themselves since their emancipation. <strong>The law abiding citizens, therefore looked with trepidation upon the preparations of the colored folk for this jubilee, and Marshal Gray took every precaution for the prevention of an outbreak.</strong> The day came and one of the most enormous civic parades ever witnessed in the United States took place. Fully ninety per cent of all the negroes in Baltimore and the surrounding country took part, either in the parade itself or as applauding spectators. It is estimated that not less than 30,000 negroes were in line. The parade marched past a certain point from before noon till well into the night before the last platoon had gone by.</p>
<p><img src="https://elipousson.github.io/posts/2015-04-26-before-freddie-gray-the-police-board-made-an-order-forbidding-public-parades/images/34808u-1600.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The Fifteenth Amendment&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Library of Congress">]</p>
<p>The populace of both races were apparently willing to fight and a general collision seemed imminent all day, but the police were everywhere, with their eyes on every man who seemed belligerently inclined. The moral influence of the force seemed to subdue the would-be rioters, and though a few unimportant brawls, took place the jubilee passed off without serious trouble anywhere in the city. Marshal Gray received flattering commendations from the newspapers and from citizens for the admirable manner in which the peace of the city was preserved during the critical period.</p>
<p>After the Emancipation Jubilee a military spirit seemed suddenly to seize the negro population of Baltimore. Dozens of military companies were formed, which drilled every evening in the streets much to the annoyance of quiet people. After the war an immense number of old-fashioned muskets were stored in the city by the United States Government. Of the old army muskets alone there were more than 12,000 stand. By some means these arms all fell into the hands of the negroes and they used them for their military companies. These organizations banded into regiments and numbered themselves the First, Second, Third, etc., Maryland Colored Regiments, although they were never admitted to the National Guard, nor recognized&nbsp;by the State military authorities. The South being at that time in a state of reconstruction the negroes were suffered to commit many offenses against the public peace which would never have been attempted or permitted on the part of the whites. <strong>Before long the negro regiments began the practice of taking full possession of every street they entered.</strong> They would march with fixed bayonets through the principal streets and clear everything before them from curb to curb. Wagons, carriages, and horse cars had to be turned back before them or else they were driven back under bayonet charge.</p>
<p>One evening in May 1871, the colored troops came down Baltimore street with fixed bayonets as usual, turning people and vehicles into side streets, when three young men who were talking together on the curb refused to move on and clear the way for the procession. A charge was made upon them and they were forced to flee around the nearest corner. As they went several of the negroes fired a volley at them and, one of the young men, a son of a well-known German citizen fell dead. He was shot through the heart. It turned out that he was a Republican in politics and had been a great friend of the negroes. They alleged that he threw a stone into the ranks of the procession but this was positively denied by every bystander. The funeral of the young German was the occasion of a large popular demonstration. Public indignation long since aroused by the offensiveness of the colored military organizations found voice in a general demand for their immediate suppression. As the negroes were in a certain sense under Federal protection, this was a difficult matter to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>The Police Board, however, made an order forbidding public parades through the streets by any military organization not connected with the National Guard or National Government.</strong> When this order was read in the meeting places of the colored companies it was received with hoots and jeers of derision. The night that the order was issued, learning that the negroes were about to parade as usual, Marshal Gray sent to the headquarters of the “Lincoln Guard,” the “crack” company of the city, and warned them not to parade. Captain Delanty was laughed at when he delivered the order, and his voice drowned by the howls of the&nbsp;negroes.</p>
<p>He then stood outside of the building with his policemen. The negroes formed in the street but at the first step they took after the captain gave the order to march the <strong>police rushed up and arrested a large number of them</strong>. The others ran back into the building. <strong>The police sent those they had captured to the station house.</strong> They then entered the building and after a short struggle captured the arms of the remainder. Their muskets gone and their leaders in jail, the militiamen became disheartened and broke up their company.</p>
<p>[tweet 592102034935013376 align=‘center’]</p>
<p>On learning the fate of their principal company, a number of other organizations surrendered their arms, and in the course of a few months practically all the muskets formerly used by the negro troops had been captured by the police. The arms were afterward sent to Fort McHenry, as they were the property of the United States.</p>

<p>On August 14, 1957, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> published an editorial inspired by the proposal to locate a new Civic Center in Druid Hill Park despite strong objections by the Baltimore Park Board. More broadly, the piece highlights some of the consequential choices that Baltimore made in the 1940s and 1950s when they traded parkland for police stations and highways. This is, in part, the story of how the Western District Police Station replaced a playground at Mount Street and Riggs Avenue.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Under the city charter the Park Board has”charge and control” of all park property. A guardian for the park system, with the power to say “no,” is needed because proposals to encroach on park property are being made all the time. Sometimes public interest justifies the proposals. Sometimes it does not. The Park Board is there to make such determinations, always with the welfare of the parks in mind.</p>
<p>We offer a few examples, just to show the kind of pressure the park system is under:</p>
<p>The State wanted 21 acres of undeveloped land in Herring Run Park in connection with plans for the Northeast expressway and the approach to the Harbor Tunnel. The Park Board went along with this.</p>
<p>This had the effect of cutting off 50 other acres of Herring Run Park. The city asked for these acres for a site for a new wholesale market. The Park Board went along. Total loss to Herring Run: 71 acres.</p>
<p>In planning an extension of Perring parkway, the city wanted 5 acres of the Mount Pleasant golf course. The Park Board was able to acquire some partially compensating acreage and went along.</p>
<p>The city concluded that a playground at Fulton and Riggs avenues, for which the Park Board planned further development, would be the ideal site for a new police station. The Park Board was finally convinced, and co-operated.</p>
<p>The city also wanted an acre of land, near Hurley and Fonthill avenues, for another police station. This was park of Gwynns Falls Park, but the Park Board, finding it not particularly desirable for park purposes ,went along.</p>
<p>Park land along Mount Royal terrace was plainly needed for the Jones Falls expressway. The board yielded the land after a scheme had been worked out which gives compensating advantages in return for the lost land.</p>
<p>Some time back, to relieve traffic congestion, the city proposed extensions of McCulloh street and Druid Hill avenue to drive through the southwest corner of Druid Hill Park. The Park Board acquiesced in this plea of necessity, after standing up for a minimum of impairment.</p>
<p>At one stage in the civic-center proceedings, a site in Clifton Park was proposed. Northing came of this.</p>
<p>At another stage in the same proceedings, a proposal was made to take over the small park adjacent to the Mount Royal Station. Nothing came of this.</p>
<p>These are merely a few of the more conspicuous episodes in what might be called a continuous war of attrition against the parks. They point up the necessity for a semi-autonomous body with power to pass judgment on all schemes for reducing out precious park acreage.</p>
<p>But now the authority of this body, the Park Board, has been defied. When the Mayor and City Council seized 30 acres of Druid Hill Park land for a civic center site, they did so against the will of the Park Board. If this seizure stands unchallenged, a shadow lies across the board’s supposed powers. The guardian of our park system will have been disarmed.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Last week, a man named Freddie Gray died of injuries received after his&nbsp;arrest by officers of the&nbsp;Baltimore City Police Department. Gray’s death and the ongoing protests have&nbsp;focused local and national media on the&nbsp;violence&nbsp;of police brutality in Baltimore City. Reading stories on the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-police-in-custody-deaths-20150422-story.html">recent history of deaths in police custody</a>, the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-gray-rough-rides-20150423-story.html">history of “rough rides”</a> in Baltimore police (both from the&nbsp;<em>Baltimore Sun</em>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;a look back on a&nbsp;decade of police brutality complaints&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-brutality-of-police-culture-in-baltimore/391158/">“The Obscene Culture of Police Brutality”</a>) have helped&nbsp;broaden my&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;of this issue. But when Gene Ryan, president of the Baltimore Police Union, stated&nbsp;protests that call for the&nbsp;arrest of the officers involved in Freddie Gray’s death <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-fop-news-conference-20150422-story.html">“look and sound like a lynch mob”</a>&nbsp;- it&nbsp;is a disturbing reminder that a deeper understanding of American&nbsp;history is essential to reforming an unjust police department.&nbsp;And much of this history is still unwritten.</p>

<p>With all of this in mind, I’ve assembled a selection of accounts reviewing the&nbsp;history of police violence against African Americans in Baltimore from&nbsp;the 1850s through the 1960s. When reading, please remember that this work&nbsp;is both incomplete and in progress. Comments and questions are welcome and I hope to update and expand this&nbsp;post&nbsp;over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can now read <a href="http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/criminal-injustice/">my draft study on criminal injustice</a>&nbsp;in Baltimore for some&nbsp;broader context on this post.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="march-1852-william-smith-killed-by-a-baltimore-police-officer-in-pennsylvania">March 1852: William Smith killed&nbsp;by a Baltimore police officer in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850">Fugitive Slave Act in 1850</a>&nbsp;enlisted local and state police in&nbsp;a renewed and expanded&nbsp;campaign to recapture&nbsp;any people who escaped from slavery in the south to free states in the north. Writing in 1883,&nbsp;William T. Alexander observed an&nbsp;“remarkable” growth in the&nbsp;“activity and universality of slave hunting” under the new law. The examples Alexander highlighted&nbsp;included&nbsp;James Hamlet captured&nbsp;in New York City at the request of&nbsp;a Baltimore slave-holder&nbsp;and the murder of William Smith in Pennsylvania by a Baltimore police officer:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That Act became a law on the 18th of September and, within ten days thereafter, a colored man named James Hamlet had been seized in the city of New York and very summarily dispatched to a woman in Baltimore, who claimed him as her slave. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The needless brutality with which these seizures were often made tended to intensify the popular repugnance which they occasioned. In repeated instances, the first notice the alleged fugitive had of his peril was given him by a blow on the head, sometimes with a club or stick of wood; and being thus knocked down, he was carried bleeding and insensible, before the facile commissioner, who made short work of identifying him and earning his ten dollars by remanding him into slavery. In Columbia, Penn., March, 1852, a colored person named William Smith was seized as a fugitive by a Baltimore police officer, while working in a lumber yard, and, attempting to escape the officer drew a pistol and shot him dead.”</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="july-31-1875-daniel-brown-killed-by-baltimore-police-officer-patrick-mcdonald">July 31, 1875: Daniel Brown killed&nbsp;by Baltimore police officer Patrick McDonald</h3>
<p>In the early morning hours of Saturday, July 31, 1875, Baltimore Police officer Patrick McDonald shot and killed Daniel Brown at his home on Tyson Street. The <em>Baltimore Sun</em> described&nbsp;the&nbsp;shooting in an account published on August 2:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Saturday morning, shortly before two o’clock, Daniel Brown, colored, of No.&nbsp;41 Tyson street, was shot in the head by police officer Patrick McDonald, of the northwestern district, and in about half an hour died from the effects of the wound. A party or sociable entertainment was going on in Brown’s house, and complaint of the noise having been made to policeman McDonald, he went to the place. Words were exchanged at the door of the house between the officer outside and the people inside. The result was that Brown was “tapped on the head” by the policeman’s club. The policeman went into the house, and there, it is alleged, shot and killed Brown without provocation. Policeman McDonald on the other hand asserts that the shooting was in self-defense. He avers that he felt his life to be in imminent peril! A coroner’s jury, after examining over a dozen witnesses rendered a verdict that “Daniel Brown came to his death by a pistolshot from the hands of policeman &nbsp;Patrick McDonald,” and on the commitment of Coroner Ogle the accused was sent to jail by Captain Earhart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial argument between McDonald and Brown started with McDonald’s demand&nbsp;to see a permit for the party (commonly known as a “cake-walk”).&nbsp;Mary Parker, a resident of 232 North Charles Street,&nbsp;testified “she was in the front room at Brown’s”&nbsp;continuing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Brown said he paid rent for the house . The officer said he”need’nt be so — saucy.” Brown had his head out the door. The officer caught Brown and struck him over the head with his club. He staggered and fell toward a closet in the front room. The police now followed his his pistol in his hand and Mrs.&nbsp;Brown behind him, begging him not to shoot. She said, “He is my husband” and the officer, saying he didn’t care a d–n,” fired. Brown never spoke after he was struck on the head. John Greason begged the officer not to shoot. The officer said the would kill every black —.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Baltimore Sun</em>&nbsp;described Brown writing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Daniel Brown, the deceased, was a dark mulatto, thirty-seven years of age, and leaves a wife but no children. He was industrious and sober, quite intelligent and strong in urging his own way. In the daytime of late he was employed as a laborer, and occasionally at night worked in Woods, Weeks &amp; Co,’s sugar refinery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Sun</em> continued to provide detailed coverage of McDonald’s trial from mid to late November. On November 24, 1875, the jury returned the verdict: “Not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.”</p>

<p>On July 24, 1884, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> reported:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Police officer F.L. Kruse, of the&nbsp; Western district, who shot John Wesley Green, colored in the back and fatally injured him last Saturday night, was exonerated by the police board yesterday, and was patrolling his beat last night. […]</p>
<p>Commissioners Milroy and Herbert voted to exonerate the officer, Mr.&nbsp;Colton dissenting. Mr.&nbsp;Colton said: “The officer did not see Green commit any offense and he did not have a warrant of law to arrest him. I consider the taking of human life too serious a matter to justify the officer in using his pistol in this case.”</p>

<p>On June 7, 1918, the <em>Afro American</em> reported on a shooting involving multiple&nbsp;Baltimore City police officers that resulted in the death of one man:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The fatal shooting of a colored man on Pennsylvania avenue by the police last Saturday night and the severe wounding of another, has aroused a great deal of comment this week. It appears that some colored men were disorderly and the police grabbed one. While dragging him to the call box some one hit the policeman with a chair. Despite the crowded condition of Pennsylvania avenue at that time, it is said the police began shooting, with the result that one man lay dead and another seriously wounded. The man killed it is averred by some was not the man who hit the policeman.</p>
<p>A ban has been placed on pedestrians, and any who stop to talk this Saturday may be arrested. Some of the police, it is alleged are gloating over the killing of the man. They look forward to making a harvest in arrests this [Saturday] night, it is being claimed.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania avenue has been what some call an “indicted street” since the recent large influx from the South and many have been arrested on Saturday nights and charged with loitering.</p>
<p>A decade ago the police indiscriminately arrested colored men and women who happened to stop even for conversation. They were invariable fined notwithstanding character witnesses appeared the next morning in a number of instances and attested to the good habits on those taken in.</p>

<p>On February 16, 1918, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>&nbsp;praised Judge Stanton for his role in protesting a recent incident of police brutality:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Judge Stanton has rendered a service in calling the attention of the Police Commissioners to the alleged brutality of a policeman in dealing with a soldier who resisted arrest… In this case, we are sorry to say, the soldier behaved like a rowdy. But, for all that, the policeman who undertook to arrest him was not justified in treating him brutally. He could have managed him, we imagine, without resorting to methods which excited indignation in the minds of spectators. The patrolman was in civilian clothes at the time and the soldier naturally did not recognize his authority.</p>
<p>Discretion is a virtue that is as important as valor or as muscle on the part of a police officer. We think the Commissioners should look into this incident carefully.”</p>

<p>On June 12, 1926, the Afro-American reported on an&nbsp;efforts by Baptist ministers in Baltimore to protest the&nbsp;actions of Baltimore police officer James O. Jones in “beating up” Henry Boyer, writing:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What they termed the most brutal abuse of police authority and wanton disregard for the rights of citizens was brought out in the Monday Baptist Ministers’ meeting when the Rev J.C. Sweeney described the act of Officer James O. Jones beating up Henry Boyer on Winchester street May 31.</p>
<p>According to a version of the affair, as stated by the Rev.&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Sweeney and the boy in question, Officer Jones of the Northwestern district used his espantoon on young boyer when he “sassed” him when told to move on from the corner of Stricker and Winchester streets.</p>
<p>Boyer stated that when he did not move fast enough the officer seized him and he asked that before he was arrested he be allowed to send word to his mother. He was then beaten up until he was “bloody” he declared. At the station house the officer said Boyer “sassed” him and resisted arrest…</p>
<p>When the case was brought up in the Criminal Court Wednesday Judge O’Dunne told the officer that “sassing” an officer would not be considered a disturbance of the public peace in his court. “It might be a disturbance of the peace of the officer, but did not constitute a breach of the law against the public,” he stated. He held the boy’s case under advisement.</p>
<p>The practice of beating up citizens and then preferring charges of resisting arrest against them was also discussed by the ministers. It was pointed out that efficient officers were always able to arrest even criminals without the use of their sticks, and that even an amateur officer ought to be able to take a lad to the station house without having to “subdue” him by battering his head up.</p>
<p>Another practice which is said to be common among some officers is to mete punishment themselves for things said to them by those they arrest. This punishment is against the law, it is said, and those so treated should take their cases always to the Criminal Court, it was advised.</p>

<p>On March 22, 1930, the Afro reported on the death of Roosevelt Yates after he was shot and killed by Herman Trautnet in&nbsp;his home at 905 Bennett Place:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Police here chalked up another victim when Officer Herman Trautner shot and fatally wounded Roosevelt Yates during arrest of the latter at his home, 905 Bennett Place, Monday. [Trautner]&nbsp;shot Roosevelt in the chest after the latter had grabbed the officer’s espantoon before it landed in a blow on his head, it was said. In his report, officer Trautner declared that he shot in self defense when Yates started towards him with the night stick after wresting it from his hand in a struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 29, 1930, the <em>Afro</em>&nbsp;reflect on the killing as a pattern of brutality by the Baltimore police:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Baltimore police killed their eight victim in six years last week when Officer Herman Trautner, white, killed Roosevelt Yates, an unarmed man he was seeking to arrest. Five others had been killed by policemen in fifteen years previously. As a result of these thirteen shootings, only one policeman has been punished. […]</p>
<p>The trouble is police brutality in Baltimore has gone as far as some people are going to stand. Men and women are usually willing to be arrested but not clubbed by police. This is especially true as to those persons who are engaged in a mere wordy brawl.</p>
<p>Of the eight men killed, five have been murdered by police of the Northwestern district, administered by Captain Charles Lastner. As the AFRO has repeatedly pointed out, the difference between the conduct of Baltimore police in the Northwestern district and the Southeastern district is the difference between right and wrong. If police can be gentlemen in southeast Baltimore, they can be gentlemen in the northwestern part of the city.</p>
<p>Every unnecessary drop of blood shed by murderous police we place at the doors of, first, Captain Lastner who is responsible for directions given his own men, and secondly, Police Commissioner Gaither who permits Captain Lastner to continue his policy of “shoot first, investigate and explain later.”</p>

<p>On February 7, 1942, the Afro reported on the death of Thomas Broadus after he was shot and killed by Edward R. Bender:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&nbsp;In the presence of scores of persons who were passing along Baltimore’s busy Pennsylvania Avenue late Saturday night, Patrolman Edward Bender, Northwestern district officer, shot and killed Private Thomas Broadus, 26, Pittsburgh, a member of the 1322nd Service Unit at Fort George G. Meade.</p>
<p>Witnesses said that Patrolman Bender (who is the same policeman that killed Charles Parker, 24, of 217 Colvin Street, February 14, 1940) then keep the crowd at bay by brandishing his revolver until other policeman arrived in several radio cars. The unconscious form of the soldier, drafted nine months ago, was placed in a patrol wagon, witnesses said, and taken to Provident Hospital, where it was pronounced dead five minutes after being admitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By&nbsp;late April of 1942, protests over the&nbsp;shooting sparked Baltimore Civil Rights advocates to organize the&nbsp;March on Annapolis&nbsp;with around&nbsp;1,800 African Americans&nbsp;traveling to the state capital to protest police brutality and racial discrimination. The march forced the Baltimore&nbsp;police to appoint the city’s first uniformed black police officers and led Governor Herbert R. O’Conor to appoint&nbsp;a statewide Commission on Problems Affecting the Negro Population.</p>
<p>On September 25, 1942, the <em>Afro</em> reported&nbsp;that the commission&nbsp;released a report urging the Bender case to be reopened:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Charging that there is prima facie evidence that the killing by Patrolman Edward R. Bender, of the Northwestern district, of a Negro soldier last February “was unlawful,” a subcommittee of the State Commission to Study Colored Problems yesterday recommended the case be resubmitted to the grand jury.</p>
<p>In a report highly critical of the administration of Robert F. Stanton as Police Commissioner, the subcommittee also characterized as “unsatifsactory” the handling of the case by J. Bernard Wells, State’s Attorney.</p>

<p>On June 10, 1946, the Baltimore Sun reported on the&nbsp;organized protests in response to the shooting&nbsp;of Wilbur Bundley by patrolman Walter J. Weber:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Calling for a more militant attitude by the Negroes of Baltimore in the maintenance of their constitutional rights and privileges, speakers at a meeting held in Leadenhall Baptist Church yesterday afternoon charged the city’s police with brutality toward both white and Negro citizens.</p>
<p>The speakers who included Leo V. Miller, a white member of the board of Crownsville State Hospital for Negroes, based their charge largely on the death of Wilbur Bundley, Negro, shot fatally on May 19 by Patrolman Walter J. Weber of the Southern district police.&nbsp;[…]</p>
<p>Addison S. Pinkney, executive secretary of the Baltimore branch of the N.A.A.C.P., which, with the Citizens League of South Baltimore, sponsored yesterday’s meeting, said “We believe this case will stop police brutality in Baltimore both against whites and Negroes.”</p>
<p>“We serve notice on the authorities that we now are acting as a group and not as individuals” […] “This is the first case in the city where the force of the Negro population can be shown,” he added. “This is the best case we ever had.”</p>

<p>Delegate Clarence M. Mitchell 3d (D., Fourth), said he had testimony from about fifteen eyewitnesses swearing that Patrolman Russell and Patrolman Joseph Mulling had beaten Louis C. Petty, 44, a Negro, of the 500 block Edgewood street, after they had arrested and handcuffed him. […]</p>
<p>Petty died of head injuries yesterday afternoon in Franklin Square Hospital.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="july-11-1964-vernon-leopold-shot-and-killed-by-william-ray">July 11, 1964: Vernon Leopold shot and killed by William Ray</h3>
<p>On July 11, 1964, Vernon Leopold was shot and killed by Baltimore police officer William Ray, as the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> reported on July 18:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Vernon Leopold, 28, was the Negro shot July 11 by Patrolman William Ray, 31, a veteran of 10 years on the Baltimore force. Police said Ray was attacked by Leopold. The NAACP said Ray provoked Leopold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 31, the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> reported on the testimony at a&nbsp;preliminary hearing on a charge of homicide against William Ray:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Defense and prosecution witnesses differed sharply yesterday on the question as to whether Patrolman William Ray was drunk July 11 when he shot and killed 28-year-old Vernon Leopold.</p>
<p>A day-long stream of witnesses poured into an unusual hearing in Central Municipal Court that was partially designed to meet the mounting criticism against secret grand jury hearings of cases involving the use of police force against private citizens during arrests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Witnesses and police officials who testified notably disagreed on whether William Ray was drunk at the time of shooting and on&nbsp;his role in provoking the&nbsp;&nbsp;conflict.&nbsp;Charges against William Ray were dismissed on July 31.&nbsp;The Maryland Conference&nbsp;of the&nbsp;NAACP responded by calling for&nbsp;a federal investigation of the Baltimore City Police Department, passing a resolution summarized by&nbsp;the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>&nbsp;on August 2:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Statements made on the character of Negro witnesses during the extraordinary twenty-hour preliminary hearing on homicide charges against Patrolman William Ray were criticized in yesterday’s resolution as: “…a deliberate effort to discredit the entire Negro community by creating the false impression that its leaders are without principle.”</p>
<p>The patrolman’s attorney, Paul Berman, in his summation of his case, called the State’s witnesses “murderers, cutthroats, thieves… and now, deliberate, inspired, manufactured perjurers.”</p>

<p>In early 2014,&nbsp;started work on a historic context on Civil Rights and Baltimore’s&nbsp;African American community organized around themes including&nbsp;equitable education, voting rights, and public accommodation.&nbsp;I&nbsp;put together <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/civil_rights_history_baltimore">an extensive bibliography of secondary sources</a>&nbsp;but I had difficulty finding any scholarship on the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/civil_rights_history_baltimore/items/collectionKey/IKU4MNVS">theme&nbsp;of criminal injustice in Baltimore</a>. By&nbsp;February,&nbsp;reflecting on&nbsp;the protests following the grand jury decision in the case of Eric Garner’s death in New York, I decided to pursue additional primary research on this topic.

<p>I&nbsp;spent a good part of the winter holidays researching the history of vacancy,&nbsp;demolition and salvage in Baltimore. When&nbsp;local builders tore down many of the&nbsp;city’s earliest&nbsp;homes&nbsp;in the decades after the Civil War, it is likely that laborers&nbsp;salvaged bricks&nbsp;and&nbsp;metal for reuse or resale. The&nbsp;January 1891 demolition of&nbsp;Tusculum, however, stood out&nbsp;as an early example of&nbsp;salvage for sentiment rather than simple material utility:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“‘Gwynn’s Folly,’ the quaint but pretentious little building of classic architecture which stood for years in Bank lane, between St.&nbsp;Paul and Calvert streets, has disappeared before the march of modern improvement, and nothing now marks the spot where it stood but a pile of rubbish and the five stately elms that for nearly a century had guarded it… The ancient edifice had a warm place in the hearts of many a white-haired Baltimoreans, and pieces of its mantel-pieces and bits of its woodwork were eagerly gathered up for souvenirs… About 1830 the improvements of the neighborhood shut in and hid the ‘Tusculum’ and converted Bank lane into an alley… For a number of years past a family of colored people have made the noted Tusculum their home.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Gwynn, newspaper owner and editor, commissioned architect Robert Carey Long&nbsp;to design and build&nbsp;Tusculum around 1820. Gwynn hosted meetings of a group that became known as the Delphian Club up through the 1830s.&nbsp;Carleton Jones described a typical&nbsp;scene&nbsp;in a&nbsp;1991&nbsp;article:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“On the right night, visitors to Tusculum’s part of town (just northwest of Calvert and Baltimore streets) can hear sounds of revelry within the mansion. Inside, you are likely to find an all-male gang of revelers that makes up the closest Baltimore ever came to having a literary club in the style of new and old England. Gwynn brings them together around the tobacco canisters and the punch bowls and they are hoisting toasts merrily here and there. For a time, they even run their own literary journal.</p>
<p>In the crowd occasionally is Harvard College luminary Jared Sparks, who had come to Baltimore to be ordained at the famous Unitarian service where William Ellery Channing would define Unitarian faith. Also among Tusculum habitues are two men destined to write the verses to two of the most immortal clinkers of 19th century sentimental song: Sam Woodworth (“The Old Oaken Bucket”) and John Howard Payne (“Home, Sweet Home”).</p>
<p>Gwynn’s perennial guests dubbed themselves the Delphian Club, and luminaries of the day flocked to get in the act – legal giant William Wirt, who trained eminent men; attorney William Pinckney, whose practice dominated many Supreme Court cases of the day; John Pendleton Kennedy, author of the novel “Swallow Barn,” and often characterized as the James Fenimore Cooper of Maryland; and John Neal, who created the nation’s first nationally important sporting magazine.”</p>

<p>I’ve been spending some time worrying over&nbsp;issues of transparency&nbsp;and&nbsp;participation in public humanities projects like historic designations and other writing about neighborhood history. Instead of hiding my work&nbsp;until&nbsp;I&nbsp;complete the “finished product” - whether that is a National Register nomination or a walking tour program - I’m interested in making more of my work public, visible and&nbsp;subject to feedback and criticism throughout the process. This idea is inspired in part by the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science">“open notebook science”</a>&nbsp;and I’m&nbsp;curious to see&nbsp;how it works for me as a scholar and practitioner.</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m working on a National Register Historic District Nomination for the neighborhood of Midtown Edmondson. I&nbsp;met last night with a group of neighborhood residents who are volunteering to support the project and provide feedback on the draft nomination.&nbsp;One neighbor&nbsp;recalled the&nbsp;Super Pride location at W.Lafayette Avenue and N. Payson Street and asked that a history of the store be&nbsp;included. Here is my first draft of a short summary - I’ll likely update the post if I have any corrections or additions:</p>
<hr>
<p>Super Pride was established by Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt “Super Jet Market” located on East Chase Street. Renaming the business Super Pride, he restored&nbsp;the business to profitability&nbsp;within three years&nbsp;despite the challenge of some food companies that&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;a black-owned store. Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court Chain of Ethical Pharmacies - a business&nbsp;that according to Burns’ obituary, “catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.”</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns’ leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city’s shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Over the past year,&nbsp;I’ve helped to start the <a href="http://rightsizeplace.org/">Preservation Rightsizing Network</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring greater attention to the intersecting issues of historic preservation and “rightsizing” in cities like Baltimore.&nbsp;My participation in this project has sparked my interested in digging into the history of how&nbsp;vacant properties have been discussed and managed in Baltimore throughout our city’s history.</p>

</div>
<p>Initial research turned up <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-10-07/news/1994280069_1_vacant-lot-vacant-homes-schmoke">a report&nbsp;from 1994</a>&nbsp;highlighting&nbsp;an initiative (“never tried before on a citywide scale in Baltimore”) by Mayor Kurt Schmoke to restore or raze vacant rowhouses. Digging back a bit earlier, I found discussion under Mayor Theodore McKeldin who sought and received a new local ordinance allowing the city to demolish houses after they had been “boarded” for ninety days or more. McKeldin&nbsp;tied vacant houses to public health and safety, remarking in 1964:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Vacant houses not only have a blighting effect on the areas around them but they are also an open invitation to vandals and a potential hazard for children who attempt to play within such buildings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was&nbsp;unsurprised to find&nbsp;these connections back to post-WWII urban renewal efforts but I am even more intrigued by the intense&nbsp;debate around vacancy that took place over fifty years before&nbsp;in the summer of 1910.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;August 21, 1910, the Baltimore Police Board Published a&nbsp;“complete census” to count&nbsp;all of the city’s vacant and occupied dwellings.&nbsp;A&nbsp;member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;prominent local real estate firm William Martien &amp; Company had suggested the survey to the Secretary of the board, reportedly,&nbsp;“As a result of the agitation over the number of vacant houses.” The census found that the Northwestern district led the city with over 1,300 vacant dwellings. Realtor James Cary Martien&nbsp;pointed to the city’s rapid suburban growth and the aging core as the cause, remarking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the weeks that followed the publication of the report, a series of letters to the&nbsp;<em>Sun</em> expanded on&nbsp;Martien’s summary and tied the issue to the fights over “negro invasion” and the aggressive efforts by some white elected officials and property-owners to enforce&nbsp;racial segregation in residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p>When some residents argued that high taxes brought on vacant and abandoned houses, one northwest Baltimore resident wrote back under the name “Pure White”&nbsp;in a letter published on August 27&nbsp;—</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Taxes may, and I presume do, have something to do with it; for our taxes are inordinately and unnecessarily high, but the possibility, and indeed the probability, of the negro neighbor is the main reason…</p>
<p>When a man works and saves and buys a home thinking it will be his shelter in his old age, and wakes up some morning to find he has a negro neighbor, he feels hurt and aggrieved that he has to give up his home, but he moves… I know of three families who want to buy a home this fall and they prefer the city to the suburbs, but they are hesitating because of this disagreeable possibility. We of the northwestern section have enough to bear in our close proximity to their noisy and disagreeable alleys, and we don’t want them next door to us. The real estate men—a few of them, not all—are to blame for the vacant houses and with them, lies the remedy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 2, 1910, another local echoed this sentiment and signed their letter “Justice” in a call for&nbsp;the city to protect him from the possibility of black neighbors —</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The writer has been living for nearly half a century in a neighborhood now threatened with negro invasion. There are several vacant houses in the block, and this fear may be the potent cause of non-rental or sale. Each vacant house is a standing menace to the rest. We live in daily dread that we may be driven out and forced to sell at a depreciated price if we can sell at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 15, 1910, another letter recognized&nbsp;the alarming&nbsp;“negro invasion” but still gave priority to the&nbsp;threat of high taxes&nbsp;—</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The vacant house problem in the city should be one of grave concern at this time to our municipal administrators, to our real estate agents and to those having the welfare of the city at heart.</p>
<p>It is not a temporary but a growing evil that is confronting and threatening every owner of property. The number of vacant houses has grown and grown until at last there is common alarm in the matter, and justly so. What then are the causes producing this condition? There are many, but the fundamental one is purely economic—high taxes.</p>
<p>There are other contributing causes, but high taxes are essentially at the root of this ever dangerously increasing trouble. Negro invasion into heretofore white residential neighborhoods is undoubtedly aggravating the situation, and the alarm at such invasion is becoming more and more evidenced by the strained and tense feeling of the people residing in such invaded neighborhoods.”</p>

<p>I’m hoping to put a bit more time into this research over the next month and give these letters the context they deserve. Check out <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2498&amp;context=mlr">Garrett Power’s excellent 1983 history</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the city’s&nbsp;residential racial segregation ordinances in&nbsp;the early 1910s for some excellent background.</p>
<p><em>Sources: All of the letters are from the Baltimore Sun through the <a href="http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/database.aspx?id=60196">ProQuest Historical Newspapers database</a>&nbsp;- I’ll come back and add full citations sometime this week.</em></p>
