I just stumbled across [an amazing piece printed in very first issue of the Maryland Colonization Journal](http://books.google.com/books?id=VOgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false) in 1841. The piece - titled "An Important Subject Noted" - excerpts in full another article published in the _Emancipator and Free American_ - an abolitionist paper published in New York and Boston.

In the piece, I was excited to find a reflection on the interracial makeup of the forces at the 1814 Battle of North Point and the the naval forces more broadly during the War of 1812. The example is used to illustrate the nation's retreat from an integrated military (the U.S. Army formally prohibited enlistment for "Negroes and Mullatoes" in 1820) and urge free blacks to maintain an 'organized neutrality in the case of a military conflict involving the U.S. writing:

> "Shall we a third time kiss the foot that crushes us? If so, we deserve our chains. No! let us maintain an organized neutrality, until the laws of the Union and of all the states have made us free and equal citizens."

[The full piece](http://books.google.com/books?id=VOgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA173#v=onepage&q&f=false) is pretty fascinating but I pulled the quote on the Battle of North Point and the War of 1812 for its particular local interest.

_**An Important Subject Noted**_

The 'Emancipator and Free American,' the leading abolition paper of the north, has the following article which we copy entire that our Maryland readers may know something of what is going on out o'doors... _we consider its character the most seditious and mischievous of any thing we have lately seen_...

_**The Duty of Coloured Americans**_ ...

A large proportion of the seamen by whom our principal victories were gained in that war, were men of colour, who were then enlisted without restriction, but now we have a standing general order of the navy, that not more than five in a hundred seamen enlisted, shall be coloured -- and this is officially explained to be for the purpose of confining coloured men to menial services on board our vessels of war! Said a brave man in Baltimore, who fought in the defence of North Point and afterwards served against Algiers in the Guerriere,

> 'there we stood intermingled, white and coloured, manning the same gun, and shot down indiscriminately; the officers exhorted us to fight bravely in the defence of our country; and then after the war was over they tried to get us to go to Africa, and told us that was our country; but I will not go. I feel that this is my country and that I shall never go out of it alive.'

The Maryland Colonization Journal was published by the Maryland State Colonization Society an organization dedicated to promoting the transportation of manumitted enslaved people and free blacks to the west coast of Africa from 1827 to 1863. Records and correspondence from the  history of the Maryland State Colonization Society are housed at the Maryland Historical Society ([MS 571](http://www.mdhs.org/findingaid/maryland-state-colonization-society-papers-1827-1871-ms-571)) and a substantial portion of the microfilm from that collection has been [digitized by the Maryland State Archives](http://speccol.mdarchives.state.md.us/pages/speccol/collection.aspx?speccol=5977).
