_I wrote this post back in January as a proposal for [THATCamp Columbus](http://thatcampcolumbus.org/2010/01/14/how-do-we-share-our-knowledge-of-historic-places/)._

How do scholars, activists, tourists, neighbors, city planners, and preservationists find and share information about historic places in their communities, in their cities, and in their regions? How do they identify relationships between places or understand the context within such places were constructed, occupied, or even destroyed? In most cases, anyone interested in these questions might rely on a wide range of tools and resources, such as calling a [local historical society](http://columbuslandmarks.org/), finding a walking tour brochure at a [local visitor center](http://www.experiencecolumbus.com/), visting the [local history section of the neighborhood library](http://columbuspublic-genealogy.blogspot.com/), searching a web-based database provided by [a State Historic Preservation Office](http://www.ohiohistory.org/resource/histpres/index2.html), or simply searching online in the hope that someone might have already investigated the location. The latter is often productive but resources are currently fragmented both topically and geographically, as well as suffering from an absence of essential features such as mapping, sorting or filtering. If you are searching for information on historic theaters [Cinema Treasures](http://cinematreasures.org/) is indispensable, roadside architecture can be found at [RoadsideArchitecture.com](http://www.roadsideamerica.com/), the [Labelscar](http://www.labelscar.com/) retail history blog has documented hundreds of shopping malls but none of these sites allow the consideration of the unusual buildings within their local contexts. For example, what African-American neighborhood did the [Comet Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theater/30504/) serve? What was located at the site of the [Westland Mall](http://www.labelscar.com/ohio/westland-mall) prior to its construction in 1969?

In addition, while a few websites offer a rich user experience, the web services provided by State Historic Preservation Offices are often severely limited by accident or by design (as some local and state governments license their data on historic places to private contracts if they maintain an updated database at all). Take a look at the [National Register database provided by the Maryland Historical Trust](http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/index.html) or the [basic PDF list provided by Virignia](http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/RegisterMasterList.pdf) to get a sense of the limited services provided by government institutions in this regard. Even more effective examples, such as the [Pennsylvania Historical Markers website](http://explorepahistory.com/abouthm.php) or the [National Register NPS Focus database](http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natreghome.do?searchtype=natreghome), are often closed and provide few opportunities to even make comments, let alone access the underlying database for mashups or analysis. Regrettably, few preservation organizations even at a state or municipal level, let alone small museums, nonprofit preservation advocacy organizations, neighborhood and city historical societies, have sufficient technical expertise or capacity within their organizations to build and maintain new and effective web applications.

Even with the issues I’ve identified with both independent and publicly supported websites sharing data on historic places, the most serious issue is the great extent to which our knowledge of historic places is limited to the minds of a few individuals in our communities, in a box of documents sitting in a damp basement, or a drawer full of unlabeled photos at a neighborhood church. I’m curious to explore the potential of building websites that support sharing our knowledge of historic places, capturing new knowledge from those who hold it, and allowing scholars, activists, and interested citizens to explore this data at local, regional and national scales. Possible models for this approach may lie with smaller projects such as the [Philadelphia Architects and Buildings Database](http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/), the [North Carolina Architects & Builders](http://ncarchitects.lib.ncsu.edu/) project, the University of Berkley’s [California’s Living New Deal](http://livingnewdeal.berkeley.edu/) project, [Teaching + Learning Cleveland](http://csudigitalhumanities.org/exhibits/), the [Community Almanac](http://www.communityalmanac.org/) from The Open Planning Project, the [Open Plaques](http://www.openplaques.org/) website, and dozens of others.
