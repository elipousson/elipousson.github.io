[![Baltimore 1814 | Every Day is Monumental](images/monumental-1814.jpg)](http://historicsprawl.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/monumental-1814.jpg)Not much blogging over here lately but there is plenty of exciting material going up at [Baltimore 1814](http://1814.baltimoreheritage.org). I'm also pretty excited about our new [Battle of Baltimore](http://www.battleofbaltimore.org) site and a few other exciting project at [Baltimore Heritage](http://www.baltimoreheritage.org).
