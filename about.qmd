Hello! My name is Eli Pousson. I am a planner and program coordinator with the [Baltimore City Department of Planning](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/), a former non-profit worker at [Baltimore Heritage](https://baltimoreheritage.org/) and the Neighborhood Design Center, a teacher for the [University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) GIS Certificate Program](https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/geographic-information-systems/), and local historian in Baltimore, Maryland.

Since 2020, I've been an enthusiastic R package developer. I've created several R packages for mapping and analyzing data related to Baltimore City and Maryland:

- [mapbaltimore](https://elipousson.github.io/mapbaltimore/)
- [bcpss](https://elipousson.github.io/bcpss/)
- [mapmaryland](https://elipousson.github.io/mapmaryland/)

I've also created (or made big contributions) to a few packages for working with spatial data or accessing useful APIs:

- [sfext](https://elipousson.github.io/sfext/)
- [getdata](https://elipousson.github.io/getdata/)
- [esri2f](https://github.com/elipousson/esri2sf)
- [crashapi](https://elipousson.github.io/crashapi/)

In 2020, I completed Master’s of Public Health degree at Johns Hopkins University as a Fellow with the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health Bloomberg American Health Initiative. My work during the program included completed [an analysis of 311 requests](https://elipousson.github.io/sewage-backups/index.html) for basement sewage backups in Baltimore and advocacy for the creation of Baltimore’s Slow Streets program in early 2020.

Here are a few projects from my prior work at [Baltimore Heritage](https://baltimoreheritage.org/):

- [Explore Baltimore Heritage](https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/)
- [Baltimore’s Civil Rights Landmarks](https://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/)
